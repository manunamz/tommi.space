A public good is a good not provided or underprovided by the market because the private sector has no incentive to provide them.

Public goods may be provided by the private sector, as well as private goods can be provided by the public sector.

Public goods are non-excludable and non-rival.

<br>

### Excludability

A good is considered to be excludable if some individual can be <u>excluded from consuming it</u>. On the other hand, non-excludable goods are technically impossible to be provided to a limited set of people.

<br>

### Rivalry

A good is defined as rival if, once provided, the additional **resource cost** of another person consuming it is positive; a non-rival good, instead, there is no additional resource cost if another person consumes the good. A non-rival good can <u>simultaneously be consumed by more than one people</u>.

<br>
<br>

## Free-riding

The act of free-riding consists in exploiting the non-excludability of public goods and not contributing to them since they are provided in any case.

<br>

### Prisoner’s dilemma

A game theory case:

Two friends are planning to share the cost for a fireworks show. The cost of fireworks is $x$, and the benefit for the friend A is going to be $y$, while for friend B it is going to be $y-1$.

|                        | B contributes                           | B doesn’t contribute |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **A contributes**      | $y-\frac{x}{2}$,&emsp;$y-1-\frac{x}{2}$ | $y-x$,&emsp;$y-1$    |
| **B doesn’t contribute** | $y$,&emsp;$y-1-x$                       | <b class="wtf">???</b>                     |

<br>

### Solutions

- **Forced provisions**
- **Openness**: sharing data concerning how who contributed more benefited more from a given service, and also it would be clear who the free-riders are
- **Punishment and/or reward**: contributors may punish free-riders, while rewarding who contributes appears to be an inefficient solution.
- A public good is provided only if a **threshold** is surpassed, so that everyone is stimulated to contribute.
- **Tax concessions** for contributors
- **Voting**: voting to get a public good, and everyone is forced to pay if the vote passes.

<u>Public intervention is costly</u>: different schools propose different solutions.

I found out about [Quantified Self](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_self) from [the list about it](https://project-awesome.org/woop/awesome-quantified-self) on [Project Awesome](https://project-awesome.org). I'm trying to embrace this philosophy and lifestyle, because I believe in it. Nevertheless, I'm struggling a lot with the logging part, since I'm a scatterbrain.

Self tracking is one of my tools towards [[Self improvement]].

## My tracings
- [[Dreams logging]]: write down summaries of dreams
- [[Esame di coscienza]]: every night, revise the events of the day to check what could be improved and what shouldn't be repeated.

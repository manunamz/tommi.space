A premise: I have a fetish for Typography. I really do. I often find myself tweaking font faces when instead I have much more important and urgent things to take care of, or I spend a long time watching super technical videos and documentaries on the history of design and visual representation of writing. I wonder how would it be if I chose it as my main interest, alto at a professional level. Nevertheless, I love it, and by checking the insights below, you might be struck by its power and beautiful effectiveness, too.

<br>

- [The Vignelli Canon](http://vignelli.com), a book on design, **the** book on design, by [Massimo Vignelli](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Massimo_Vignelli) (the legend who [designed the whole graphic of New York](https://nyti.ms/1mzoUBo)). This book inspired me, so much that it completely changed how I see the world (and made me fall in love with Typography).
- [*I font preferiti dagli scrittori italiani*](https://www.ilpost.it/2020/02/09/font-preferiti-scrittori-italiani/), on [Il Post](https://ilpost.it).
- Articles tagged with “[fonts](https://www.ilpost.it/tag/font/)” on [Il Post](https://ilpost.it).

## Fonts

- [Smelvetica](http://tholman.com/post/smelvetica), a funny customization of [Helvetica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica).
- [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter), a wonderful Open Font by [Rasmus Andersson](https://github.com/clauseggers/Playfair-Display).   
Update 3<sup>rd</sup> December 2020: the day I'll stop loving Inter and use it as my main font ==everywhere== I better provide some valid explanations or I won't be myself anymore; I totally love it.
	- [play with it](https://rsms.me/inter/lab/)
	- [why](/genesi#tipografia) this website uses Inter
- [Merriweather](https://github.com/SorkinType/Merriweather), ~~the serif font I use on this blog~~ (not anymore), it’s designed by [Eben Sorkin](http://sorkintype.com/about.html).   
Update 3<sup>rd</sup> December 2020: I've been deluded: like [Playfair Display](https://github.com/clauseggers/Playfair-Display), it feels AWESOME at the beginning, it then gets itchy and bothering after a while.
- [Graphik](https://commercialtype.com/catalog/graphik), Sans Serif
- Garamond is the most widely used and loved font in the italian publishing industry, and to me it's the best serif font for narrative writing. [EB Garamond](http://www.georgduffner.at/ebgaramond/) is its renewed, open, digitally friendly alternative, and I use it when I want to use serif in my blog. Its designer is [a great guy](http://georgduffner.at/)

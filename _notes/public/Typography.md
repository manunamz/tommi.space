Typography is a wonderful world, hidden in plain sight. Here there are some resources for inspiration and study.
A premise: I have a fetish for Typography. I really do. I often find myself tweaking font faces when instead I have much more important and urgent things to take care of, or I spend a long time watching super technical videos and documentaries on the history of design and visual representation of writing. I wonder how would it be if I chose it as my main interest, alto at a professional level. Nevertheless, I love it, and by checking the insights below, you might be struck by its power and beautiful effectiveness, too.

- [<cite>The Vignelli Canon</cite>](https://rationale-design.com/resources/vignelli-canon/ "The Vignelli Canon on Rationale Design"), a book on design, **the** book on design, by [Massimo Vignelli](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Massimo_Vignelli "Massimo Vignelli on Wikipedia") ([a legend](https://nyti.ms/1mzoUBo "Massimo Vignelli, Visionary Designer Who Untangled the Subway, Dies at 83")). This book inspired me so much that it completely changed how I see the world (and made me fall in love with Typography, too). My notes on the book in [[The Vignelli Canon]].
- [*I font preferiti dagli scrittori italiani*](https://www.ilpost.it/2020/02/09/font-preferiti-scrittori-italiani/ "I font preferiti dagli scrittori italiani - Il Post"), on [Il Post](https://ilpost.it).
- Articles tagged with “[fonts](https://www.ilpost.it/tag/font/)” on [Il Post](https://ilpost.it).
- [Web Typography](http://webtypography.net/ "Web Typography"), a website focused on typography on the Web, [Richard Rutter](http://clagnut.com/ "Richard Rutter"). I bought [[Web Typography|the homonymous book]] on the topic, it is very insightful.
- Google Fonts [About page](https://fonts.google.com/about "Google Fonts About page").
- Font Forge [guide](http://designwithfontforge.com/en-US/index.html).
- The [Font Library](https://fontlibrary.org/ "Font Library")’s [Guidebook](https://fontlibrary.org/en/guidebook "Guidebook page on Font Library").
- [*Helvetica*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0847817/ "Helvetica on IMDb"), a documentary on the most consequential, widespread, revolutionary yet simple typeface of history.

## Fonts

- [Smelvetica](http://tholman.com/post/smelvetica "Smelvetica on Tim Holman website"), a funny customization of [Helvetica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica "Helvetica on Wikipedia") by [Tim Holman](https://tholman.com "Tim Holman's website").
- [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter "Inter official website"), a wonderful Open Font by [Rasmus Andersson](https://rsms.me "Rasmus Andersson’s website").   
Update 3<sup>rd</sup> December 2020: I will never stop loving Inter and using it **everywhere**
	- [play with it](https://rsms.me/inter/lab/ "Inter lab")
	- [why](/genesi#tipografia "Genesi, tipografia") this website uses Inter
- [Merriweather](https://github.com/SorkinType/Merriweather), ~~the serif font I use on this blog~~ (not anymore), it’s designed by [Eben Sorkin](http://sorkintype.com/about.html "About Eben Sorkin").   
Update 3<sup>rd</sup> December 2020: I've been deluded: like [Playfair Display](https://github.com/clauseggers/Playfair-Display), it feels AWESOME at the beginning, it then gets itchy and bothering after a while.
- [Graphik](https://commercialtype.com/catalog/graphik), Sans Serif
- Garamond is the most widely used and loved font in the italian publishing industry, and to me it's the best serif font for narrative writing. [EB Garamond](http://www.georgduffner.at/ebgaramond/ "EB Garamond official website") is its renewed, open, digitally friendly alternative, and I use it when I want to use serif in my blog. Its designer is [a great guy](http://georgduffner.at/ "George Duffner personal website")

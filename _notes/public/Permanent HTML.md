Seldom websites' style should be changed, since around it is built the identity of the owner and the message they want to give. Nevertheless, creative people often can’t help but being influenced by other websites’ design and graphical intuitions, so they are pushed to change, improve, tweak, experiment new appearances for their online creations.

For this reason, I believe it is very important to formerly develop and code a **[[Permanent HTML]]** structure, that is reasoning and thinking about a website HTML in order to <u>keep it valid regardless of CSS changes</u>.   
In this way modifying little graphical things is easy and no class or tag needs ever to be changed, except for radical website rewrites, which change everything from the bottom to the top.

A turther improvement of Permanent HTML is   
![[Universal HTML]]

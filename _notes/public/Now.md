## Studying

I am living in [Venice](https://www.comune.venezia.it/ "Venice institutional website"), Italy, where I am attending [Philosophy, International Studies and Economics](https://unive.it/pise "PISE course page on UniVe website") at [Ca' Foscari University](https://unive.it "Ca' Foscari University website").

## Planning <cite>Scambi Festival</cite>

With a group of curious, different and crazy guys from all over Italy, I am organizing a cultural Festival. Its name is [<cite>Scambi</cite>](https://scambi.org "Scambi"), and it is taking place in **Sanremo**, during the last week of August 2021. It is already been one year since we started working on this and we founded an association.

Everything about us and what we do is on <a href="https://scambi.org"  target="_blank" title="Scambi">our website</a>

<br>
<br>

## Projects, ideas, and collaborations

In the meanwhile, I am continuing to wander around Italy to take part and/or assist to interesting things that happen. I take note of the most important stuff [here](/stuff "Stuff - tommi.space"), and [[Tutto|here]] I log everything (literally anything) I have done.

### Quitting Social Media

I made the life-changing choice of <u class="double">deleting all of my Social Media accounts</u> by the end of 2020. (I'm a bit late, but I'm getting there) There are a lot of reasons why I got to this point, and I discuss about this topic&emsp;**a l l&emsp;t h e&emsp;t i m e**&emsp;with my friends. At the moment my aim is to put together resources, articles, videos, documentaries and documents in [this website](https://quitsocialmedia.club "Quit Social Media"). Randomly stuffed, everything is [in these notes](https://quitsocialmedia.club/notes "Quit Social Media Notes"), in the meanwhile.

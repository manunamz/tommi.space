The one you're reading is more than a simple web page, it's part [a movement](https://sive.rs/nowff). It was started by the legendary [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs "Derek Sivers' personal website") in 2015, and [it grew a lot](https://sive.rs/now3) since then. To find out more about the concept and to find out [how many people](https://nownownow.com "NowNowNow") are embracing it, visit [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com/about "About NowNowNow")

What I'm doing right now:

## Quitting Social Media

I made a life-changing choice: I'll **delete all of my Social Media accounts** by the end of 2020. There are a lot of reasons why I got to this point, and I discuss about this topic  **a l l  t h e  t i m e**  with my friends. At the moment my aim is to put together resources, articles, videos, documentaries and documents in [this website](https://quitsocialmedia.club "Quit Social Media"). Randomly stuffed, everything is [[Quit Social Media Notes|here]], in the meanwhile.

## Planning a Festival

We have no website, no detailed schedule, no definite and clear structure. We are a group of curious, different and crazy guys from all over Italy and we have an idea, a place, a time: a **festival of meetings** (which is way better than is sounds), in **Sanremo**, in August 2021. It's already been one year since we're working on this and we founded an association. I'm its president (ðŸ¤¯).

Usually, I'd suggest to subscribe to a newsletter, or I'd point to a website, but as of right now we haven't anything like this. We're working on it. Keep in touch.

## Studying

I'm attending [Philosophy, International Studies and Economics](https://unive.it/pise "PISE course page on UniVe website") at [Ca' Foscari University](https://unive.it "Ca' Foscari University website") in [Venice](https://www.comune.venezia.it/ "Venice institutional website"), Italy, where I'm living.

I made <a href="https://pise-notes.tk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="PISE Notes">this website</a>, which collects all of my notes on the course classes.

## Projects, ideas, and collaborations

In the meanwhile, I'm continuing to wander around Italy to take part and/or assist to what's happening. I take note to the most important stuff [here](/stuff "Stuff - tommi.space"), and [[Tutto|here]] I log everything (literally anything) I'm doing.

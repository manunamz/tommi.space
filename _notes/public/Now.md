## Working on <cite>Scambi Festival</cite>

With [a group of curious and crazy guys](https://scambi.org/en/about-us/ 'About us - Scambi Festival') from all over Italy, I founded and work at a Festival of workshops named [<cite>Scambi</cite>](https://scambi.org 'Scambi'), taking place in **Sanremo**, during the last week of August. The first edition, in 2021, has been a great success. We cannot wait for the second to happen, we are already working on it!

Everything about our festival is on <a href='https://scambi.org'  target='_blank' title='Scambi'>our website</a>

<br>
<br>

## Projects, ideas, and collaborations

In the meanwhile, I am continuing to wander around Italy to take part and/or assist to interesting things that happen. I take note of the most important stuff [here](/stuff 'Stuff - tommi.space'), and [[Tutto|here]] I log everything (literally anything) I have done.

### Quitting Social Media

I made the life-changing choice of <u class='double'>deleting all of my Social Media accounts</u> by the end of 2020. (I'm a bit late, but I'm getting there) There are a lot of reasons why I got to this point, and I discuss about this topic&emsp;**a l l&emsp;t h e&emsp;t i m e**&emsp;with my friends. At the moment my aim is to put together resources, articles, videos, documentaries and documents in [this website](https://quitsocialmedia.club 'Quit Social Media'). Randomly stuffed, everything is [in these notes](https://quitsocialmedia.club/notes 'Quit Social Media Notes'), in the meanwhile.

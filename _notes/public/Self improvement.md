I am a clumsy, messy, confused guy, and I need to work hard to achieve a result that a more determined and focused guy may accomplish in much less time and with greater ease. Below are some of the practices I adopt do be more self-aware, and to improve myself both physically and spiritually.

- [[Self debugging]]: sitting down, breathing, switching off anything which is switchable, and debug yourself, as you would do with a program
- [[Self tracking]]: Keeping track of anything which has to or shouldnt't occur repetitively
- [[Loops]]: acquire habits and take advantage of them to waste less time
- [[Boundaries]]: set some constraints and limit by yourself your own daily freedom, in order to achieve a greater one on an higher level
- [[Monotasking]]: one thing at a time, only one. One.
- *[[Esame di coscienza]]*: every day, at the end of the day, check what has been accomplished and what went wrong
- [[Mindfulness]] is becoming very popular and more and more people start doing it. The art of training the mind to focus and commit to the present by gifting it with few minutes a day of complete nothingness.
- [[Being a self editor]]: understanding what is important for the self in the whole life picture, as an editor does with its movie.

## About

<cite>Linuxplosion</cite> was originally conceived to edit [Everyone](/everyone). Many computerphiles friends joined me in finding the best components to use, as well as in assembling it. In particular, a huge shoutout to my friend Giorgio, who had the patience of bearing with me during all of the assembling process.

I worked as a plumber all of August 2019 to buy it, and it has definitely been worth it.

Originally, it run Windows, but in 2020 I switched to Ubuntu. The only program which I miss is Lightroom, everything else works beautifully.\
I currently don't use Linuxplosion much since it's not where I live and I seldom use it when I need great performance.

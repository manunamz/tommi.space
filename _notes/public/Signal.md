## Why WhatsApp is not good

- <q cite='https://www.justsecurity.org/10318/video-clip-director-nsa-cia-we-kill-people-based-metadata/'><a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/10318/video-clip-director-nsa-cia-we-kill-people-based-metadata/" target="_blank" title="We kill people based on metadata">We kill people based on metadata</a></q> is a sentence pronounced by [General Michael Hayden], former director of the NSA and the CIA

## Perks

The perks of Signal are simple:

1. **no data** is collected except your phone number
2. While remaining a super neat and simple messaging app, <u>it uses military-grade encryption by default</u>
3. [Its source code is open][GitHub] and publicly audited, which means that <u>anyone could check how Signal works</u> and verify its actual respect of the user’s privacy
4. Signal is owned by [a nonprofit](https://signalfoundation.org/ 'Signal Foundation'): anything about Signal has the sole purpose of serving the user, not making money. Signal survives only thanks to [donations] and [investments](https://www.wired.com/story/signal-foundation-whatsapp-brian-acton/ 'WhatsApp Co-Founder Puts $50M Into Signal To Supercharge Encrypted Messaging - WIRED').

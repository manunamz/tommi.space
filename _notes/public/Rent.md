> To days of inspiration  
> Playing hookie, **making [something out of nothing](https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/V_YlZ1JdcVk '“Something From Nothing„ — Foo Fighters')**  
> The need to express   
> To communicate,  
> To going against the grain,  
> Going insane  
> Going mad  
> To **loving tension**, no pension  
> To more than one dimension,  
> To **starving for attention**,  
> Hating convention, hating pretension  
> Not to mention of course,  
> Hating dear old mom and dad  
> To riding your bike,  
> Midday past the three-piece suits  
> To fruits to no absolutes   
> To Absolute- to choice  
> To the Village Voice  
> To any passing fad  
> **To being an us**-for once-, **instead of a them**

> <q>It doesn’t matter</q>
> <q>It was before I met you…</q>
> <q>I don’t care</q>

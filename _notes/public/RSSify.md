I'm an RSS lover.\
If it was on me, I'd use RSS everywhere. Since 99% of the people have no idea what it is and half of that 1% left think it's dead, the 0,5% of us has to find some ways to continue using it for everything, everywhere.

## How

- [A guide](https://lukesmith.xyz/blog/a-guide-to-using-rss-to-replace-social-media "A Guide on using RSS to replace Social Media") on how to RSSify Social Media, by [Luke Smith](https://lukesmith.xyz "Luke Smith personal website")

## Tools

- [PolitePol](https://github.com/taroved/pol "PolitePol repository on GitHub") is a great tool transform any webpage in a RSS feed. It's [madly expensive](https://politepol.com/en/prices "PolitePol"), so I set it up on my server. You may check and use it by visiting <http://167.86.82.148:8088>; very surprisingly I was able to configure it but it doesn't work for Twitter and Instagram, as I hoped. Therefore, it's quite useless.
- [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com "Feedbin official website") is the RSS reader I use. It's awesome.
- [NetNewsWire](http://netnewswireapp.com "NetNewsWire official website") is the local software which syncs with Feedbin. Lovely.

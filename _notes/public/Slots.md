description: "I get distracted very easily, an my mind goes from a topic to a totally different one in no time. While this can be a great quality to be creative (not so much, in the end), it's a very stressful, time-consuming and unproductive lifestyle. This is why I conceived slots."

Slots are simply **time slots**: half or full hours which I totally dedicate to something. If a new, different thing pops up in my mind, I write it down to remember it, but I get to it only when it's the time to commit to the related slot.

The Slot Philosophy is awesome because slots can be rearranged everyday, and their accomplishment can be tracked through [[Self tracking]] apps such as [Loop Habit Tracker](https://loophabits.org "Loop Habits official website") (which is the one I use).

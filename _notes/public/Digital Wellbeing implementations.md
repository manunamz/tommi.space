Interesting and curious integrations which could be implemented in the [system Digital Wellbeing](https://www.android.com/digital-wellbeing/ "Android Digital Wellbeing") app on mobile.

- a program which sums the length of each audio sent and received (and listened), summing up the **time spent recording and listening to audio messages**.
- a program which calculate a **percentage of how much each person speak in a call** / video-call, like some sort of “ball possession” percentage in soccer games.

## Why

Why quitting Flickr and why choosing Piwigo?

- Flickr is hosted on Amazon's servers
- Piwigo is open source and ethical, while Flickr is not very privacy-friendly.
- Piwigo [costs (**only**!) 39€](https://piwigo.com/pricing "Piwigo pricing page") per year (and 94€/3y), while [Flickr's price](https://help.flickr.com/pricing-faq-r1qHsTEbU "Flickr Pricing FAQ") is continuing to slightly rise every year, it isn't fixed and right now it's 65,88€ per year.
- Flickr was founded in Canada and now it's based in the US, while Piwigo was founded and it's based in France (not that what's in the US is bad, but almost every web service among the most used is American; using an European based service not only is nice, but it gives me a sense of being somewhat closer)

## Roadmap

1. Start the 30 days free trial of Piwigo
2. Install Flickr2Piwigo plugin and follow [this guide]() to import all the photos.
3. What is not noted in the blog post is that <u>the process is sloooow but stable</u>, even though it's better than I expected; on Flickr I had 17452 photos and it took me ~13 hours to complete.

Switching to Piwigo is one of the steps of the path to [[Internet Freedom]].

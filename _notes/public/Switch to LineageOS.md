In order to remove the Googleâ€™s tracking services and obtrusive bits of proprietary code, I decided to install [LineageOS][lineage] on my [OnePlus 6T][device].   
Specifically, I installed [LineageOS for MicroG](https://lineage.microg.org "LineageOS for MicroG"), which is a fork of LineageOS optimized to be used with [MicroG services](https://microg.org "MicroG Project").

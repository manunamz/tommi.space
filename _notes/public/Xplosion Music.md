### Technicalities

<u>Every song has a specific reason to be in this playlist</u>, and I am trying to explain the reason for each song, in its original language.

I decided, with a lot of struggle, to narrow down the selection to <u>only one song for every artist</u>, with very few special exceptions. I did it because I really wanted to identify the music which changed my life in some way or mark a milestone in my growth and evolution.

Nevertheless, since I could never give up some songs which I love but there is no reason strong enough for them to be in my life’s soundtrack, I maintain *[[Xplosion Music Extended]]*, which has a broader selection of music that is there for no special reason.

Since I could never choose a song over another, the following list follows the alphabetical order of the artist’s name.

<br>
<br>

## Alicia Keys, <cite>Empire State of Mind</cite>

Do you remember [those old-looking mp3 players](https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2013/07/12/12/49/mp3-player-146314_1280.png "a picture of an old-looking mp3 player") with an integrated USB?\
Well, when my aunt gave me my first one as a gift, there was only this song inside.

<br>

## Alan Silvestri, <cite>The Avengers</cite>

I love Marvel movies. I actually get crazy before watching any new one. Avengers’ theme is the perfect representation of my hype and feelings about those awesome films. I can't help but getting excited AF when this track starts playing.

<br>
<br>

## Amélie No, <cite>Where Did You Sleep Last Night</cite>

This is [a folk American song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Pines), famous all over the world because of [the great performance by Nirvana](https://youtu.be/hEMm7gxBYSc). I love this one in particular because it’s part of the soundtrack of a wonderful movie I watched as a juror at Giffoni Film Festival 2018: [<cite>Les Faux Tatouages</cite>](https://www.giffonifilmfestival.it/sezioni-film-2018/4267-fake-tattoos.html "Les Faux Tatouages in Giffoni Film Festival’s catalogue").

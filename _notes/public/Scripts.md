The following are ideas for scripts I would like to code both to learn bash and to automate most of the commands I frequently perform manually.

## Jam kitchen

- options: `[R] for a recording\n[S] to edit settings\n[Q] to quit`
- open a file whose name is read in stdin

## Slogger

Logging anything happening to my life, saving it in a shared database. A sort of front-end client for the [[Timeline development|Timeline]].

### Transfer files

I use [ADB](http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html) to transfer any file or folder from my Android device to my Mac, and this is how I do it.

Firstly, connect the phone to the computer.

Open the terminal and move to the `platform-tools` folder (I keep in `Documents`)

```sh
cd Documents/platform-tools
```

Then, check if the two devices are connected correctly by running

```sh
./adb devices
```

navigate in the phone's directories
```sh
./adb shell

ls -al
```

once the path of the directories which contain the content that has to be copied on the computer has been noted, execute:

```sh
./adb pull /path/in/phone /destination/path/on/computer
```

And it's done. This is how simple, neat, fast, and powerful this process is.

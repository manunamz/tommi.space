To keep the phone rolling smoothly, from time to time a classic data backup and factory reset are necessary, but itâ€™s important not to forget what to save before hitting the red button. These are my checklist and importing workflow.

<br>
<br>

## Laptop

- Firefox
	- export extensions configuration and settings
	- `about:config` settings check
- Espanso config

<br>
<br>

## Mobile

- Export apps settings
    - OSMAnd+ favorites and settings
- WiFi passwords
- WhatsApp
    - important messages
    - archived messages
    - global backup
- images
- audios
    - recordings
    - important WhatsApp audios
- Contacts (if not synced)
- **Two Factor Authentication App**

### Transfer files

I use [ADB](http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html) to transfer any file or folder from my Android device to my Mac, and this is how I do it.

Firstly, connect the phone to the computer.

Open the terminal and move to the `platform-tools` folder (I keep in `Documents`)

```
cd Documents/platform-tools
```

Then, check if the two devices are connected correctly by running
```
./adb devices
```

navigate in the phone's directories
```
./adb shell

ls -al
```

once the path of the directories which contain the content that has to be copied on the computer has been noted, execute:
```
./adb pull /path/in/phone /destination/path/on/computer
```

And it's done. This is how simple, neat, fast, and powerful this process is.

*Nolan* is a cross-device software aimed at painstakingly collecting all of the activity done on the device, and automatically synchronizing and analyzing it on a self-hosted server.  
Unlike currently widespread pre-installed ‚Äúdigital health‚Äù apps, *Nolan* does not only look at the currently opened app, but it should connect to each one, precisely getting what is being done on it. For instance, *Nolan* is not interested in knowing that I am reading the *New York Times*, *Nolan* wants to know *what* I am reading; in the same way, he does not care  I am watching a video, he notes *which* video I am looking at.
As a result, *Nolan* makes a huge CSV or JSON database with a **timeline** of *everything* done by the user, and parses graphs and statistics about it.

*Nolan* is some sort of a **life dashboard**: it cross-analyzes stuff you do -both online and offline- where you do it, for how long you do it, how often you do it, maybe even near whom you do it, and eventually it sums up the results serving them to you.

- subsections of this everything are put in more specific pages of the websites to add accomplishments (e.g. [[Server]], [[Tutto]], [[Giri]])
- use tags to split stuff into the above mentioned subsections
- add **locations**, too! Check OSM API to integrate the system

<br>
<br>

## Automations

- Take `page.date` and `page.updated` values of the websites‚Äô pages to automatically know the moments when they were being created/edited
- get from mobile OS stats the time spent on apps and how often they are opened.

## Tools

- [TimelineJS](https://timeline.knightlab.com "TimelineJS")
- [d3](https://github.com/d3/d3 'd3 repository on GitHub')

## Examples

Add a timeline like [Jeremy Gordon's](https://jgordon.io "Jeremy Gordon") or [jack.works](https://web.archive.org/web/20200513054829/http://jack.works/)
	- [CSS Timelines examples](https://freefrontend.com/css-timelines/ "65 CSS Timelines")
	- more promising ones:
		- https://codepen.io/ArnaudBalland/pen/rLeQgd/ (uses JavaScript)
		- https://codepen.io/triss90/pen/GqRKeW/
		- https://codepen.io/chriswrightdesign/pen/XJzNBN/, the prettier one (it has no dedicated space to dates)
		- https://codepen.io/P233/pen/lGewF/
		- https://codepen.io/rprajapatii/pen/AXoWyd (animations with JavaScript)
		- https://codepen.io/NilsWe/pen/FemfK
		- https://codepen.io/allisonching/pen/XeLjGd (simple minimal horizontal)

## Social

The underlying idea is to build a social networking platform based on significant dates for every user. A profile is made by the important milestones in both his/her life and in history in general.

Who I am is also, or mostly, defined by the events which marked my life even before my birth.

Timeline is the social network of timelines, on which anybody can share their personal timeline, choosing which events are private and which events are not.

Timeline is static, flexible, neat, minimal and simple: an `ul` of elements which are distanced proportionally with the time which separates them

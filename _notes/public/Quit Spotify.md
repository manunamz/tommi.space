Quitting Spotify is hard.

It's **very** hard, not only because it's convenient and easy to use, but mostly because almost everyone else uses it; thus creating playlists, sharing music and interacting with other music lovers becomes way harder without it. For these reasons, quitting and finding another tool to listen to music isn't enough: it's necessary to substitute the playlist creation and sharing workflow of Spotify while keeping it accessible and easy to experience for anybody.

Quitting Spotify is one of the steps of the path to [[Internet Freedom]], and it follows the “[[Make the switch]]” philosophy.

## Why

Why quitting Spotify?

- [Criticism of Spotify](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Spotify) on Wikipedia
- It costs a lot, definitely too much for the quality of the service
- I prefer not to be tracked and I'd prefer for my listening preferences not to be used for advertising purposes.

		Closing the account means deleting all playlists, thus the account can't be closed, but it must be kept with free subscription.

## Roadmap

The path I'm following to replace Spotify with other listening services

1. Evaluating other ethical streaming services
1. Copying Spotify playlist on other [FOSS alternatives](https://alternativeto.net/software/spotify/?license=opensource)
	- [OpenWhyd](https://openwhyd.org)
	- [Radio4000](https://radio4000.com/)
	- [Audius Music](https://audius.co/) (not a valid standalone option, it has its own limited music selection)
	- **?**
1. Exporting liked songs?
2. Importing liked songs in the new service?
3. [Spotify account deletion consequences](https://community.spotify.com/t5/Spotify-Answers/How-do-I-close-my-Spotify-Account/ta-p/4663172):

## On desktop

Use a combination of [YouTube] (obviously from [an Invidious instance](https://github.com/iv-org/invidious "Invidious GitHub repository")), [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com), [Audius Music](https://audius.co), [OpenWhyd](https://openwhyd.org), [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com), [Open.Audio](https://open.audio), [Resonate](https://resonate.is).

The purpose is to <u>differentiate</u> as much as possible all of the streaming services to value competition and avoid monopolization.

Ideally, the best way would be to download and store locally all of the music I listen to, as I did up to 3 years ago, but I have to admit it's not convenient at all, from every point of view.

## On mobile

1. Find the optimal [NewPipe](https://newpipe.schabi.org/) configuration.
	- How to listen to whole albums
	- How to like songs
	- How to import Spotify liked songs
	- How to improve bitrate (it's limited to 128kbps)

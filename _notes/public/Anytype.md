## Features requests

- how does Anytype connect to the outer world?
- basic data structure is in JSON?
- is the public front-end going to be customizable with a personal CSS and own TLD, etc.?
- ActivityPub/Fediverse implementation
- Spotlight search
- media files focus
- Personal data management implementation (check every CSV and its Shortcut)
- Import VCF
- Voice memos integration
- Co-existing media: not only avoid duplications in the system, but also make Anytype format compatible with other programs not only by exporting, but while files are in the app.

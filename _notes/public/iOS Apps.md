- [1Writer](https://1writerapp.com "1Writer") is arguably [the best iOS text editor](https://brettterpstra.com/ios-text-editors/ "iOS text editors comparison by Brett Terpstra"), I use it via WebDAV to edit my [Nextcloud Notes](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/notes "Nextcloud Notes App") (a.k.a. *[[The Jam]]*) on the go; the app costs 5,50€.
- [Affluences](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/affluences/id869919405 "Affluences on the App Store"), to reserve seats and book meetings for [my university](https://unive.it "Ca’Foscari University of Venice").

- [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com "Bandcamp"), mobile client for [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com "Bandcamp").
- [ChatSecure](https://chatsecure.org "ChatSecure"), a free and open source XMPP messaging client
- ~~[Cheon](https://cheon.app "Cheon Planner"), an app which syncs with CalDAV to plan study hours~~. Does not have a desktop interface, so it is quite useless.
- [Chime](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chime/id414830146 "Chime in App Store"), the homologous of [Hourly Reminder](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.github.axet.hourlyreminder/ "Hourly Reminder on F-Droid") in iOS. Even though it is a relatively old app, it still works wonderfully
- ~~[Cineast](https://www.themoviedb.org/apps/58628749c3a3681a6204357a "Cineast"), a TMDb client. It costs 1,09€~~. I should not have payed. Buggy and slow.

It is proprietary software by [Poetic Bytes](https://www.poeticbytes.com "Poetic Bytes") and it costs 3,50€~~. Definitely not worth the price: the app is buggy, it has a lot of problems and limits; I moved to Apple Podcasts… it syncs perfectly and it allows importing RSS feeds.
- ~~[CSV Editor](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/csv-easy-editor/id1000358989 "CSV Easy Editor on App Store"), a 2,29€ minimal CSV editor which I use to edit on the go [my data folder](https://github.com/xplosionmind/tommi.space/tree/main/_data "_data folder of this website on GitHub")~~.

- [FiLMiC Pro](https://www.filmicpro.com/ "FiLmiC Pro"), a super powerful app to boost video shooting from the phone and tweak as much settings as possible.

- [Firefox](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/firefox-private-safe-browser/id989804926 "Firefox"), the best browser in the world, even if on iOS it is exactly like Safari but with the Firefox interface.

Unfortunately, it is non-free software and it is developed by [Poetic Bytes](https://www.poeticbytes.com "Poetic Bytes"), in every sense; it costs 3,50€~~. Buggy and incomplete

<div class="yellow box">
	<h2>I completely degoogled my device!</h2>
	This is still <u>an ongoing process</u>, but as of right now I have <b>no Google apps</b> or services on my phone. To use Google open source APIs only, I take advantage of the great <a href="https://microg.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="MicroG">MicroG</a> services.<br>
	I will be diving deeper into this topic as soon as possible.
</div>

[[Launcher|Here]] are my notes dedicated to choosing my phone's [launcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_desktop_application_launchers "“Launchers” on Wikipedia").

- [andOTP](https://github.com/andOTP/andOTP), [2FA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication "Two Factor Autentication") app
- [AnonAddy](https://anonaddy.com "AnonAddy official website"), mobile client for [AnonAddy](https://anonaddy.com "AnonAddy official website").
- [AntennaPod](https://antennapod.org "AntennaPod"), the best podcast player for Android
- [AnySoftKeyboard](https://anysoftkeyboard.github.io "AnySoftKeyboard official website"), simple, neat and lightweight yet feature-rich keyboard. Settings are a bit messy.
- [Audius](https://audius.co "Audius Music official website"), [Audius Music](https://audius.co "Audius Music official website") mobile client.
- [Banca Etica](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.bancaetica.bank "Banca Etica on Google Play"), internet banking for [Banca Etica](https://www.bancaetica.it "Banca Etica"). It's not open source and it works very badly. Considering to uninstall it, since the web client is exactly the same.
- [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com "Bandcamp"), mobile client for [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com "Bandcamp").
- [Barinsta](https://barinsta.austinhuang.me/en/latest/ "Barinsta official website"), a lightweight Instagram client for Android. You cannot post from there, but you can search and view public stuff without having to login.
- Bible Study
- ~~[Blokada](https://blokada.org/), efficient and powerful ad blocker. It has some issues working with VPN on, still trying to fix it~~. Not compatible with VPN.
- ~~[Book Reader](https://gitlab.com/axet/android-book-reader), a book reader with a simple UI~~ Librera Reader is way better.
- [BOOM](https://www.ultimateears.com/features/apps.html "Ultimate Ears apps"), an app to fully access my two [UE BOOM 2](https://www.ultimateears.com/en-us/wireless-speakers/boom-2.html) speakers’ features
- [Cythara](https://github.com/gstraube/cythara "Cythara"), guitar tuner
- [DAVx<sup>5</sup>](https://www.davx5.com/ "DAVx5 official website"), to sync contacts, calendar, and reminders via [WebDAV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV)

- [Element](https://element.io "Element") the most common and stable [Matrix](https://matrix.org "Matrix") client
- ~~[Etar](https://github.com/Etar-Group/Etar-Calendar), a simple, light and very nice calendar~~ it was a lie, it was old and I fear its development is discontinued. Replaced it with Simple Calendar Pro.
- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/ "F-Droid"), a [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software "“FOSS on Wikipedia”") app store. My aim is to quit Google Play completely and just use this; [[Road to Internet Freedom|almost there]].
- [FairEmail](https://email.faircode.eu/ "FairEmail"), the name says it all
- [Fedilab](https://fedilab.app/ "Fedilab"), an Android client to post to the [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse), I use it for [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) and [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org/).
- [Freezer](https://freezer.life "Freezer"), stream super high quality music from Deezer, for free
- [FeedMe](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.seazon.feedme "FeedMe on Google Play Store"), an RSS reader app which syncs with [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com "Feedbin")
- [FiLMiC Pro](https://www.filmicpro.com/ "FiLmiC Pro"), a super powerful app to boost video shooting from the phone and tweak as much settings as possible. I paid for it and it is not open source, because -unfortunately- [there’s no app like it](https://alternativeto.net/software/filmic-pro/?license=opensource).
- ~~I don’t care about bells and whistles while browsing on mobile, since I mostly read articles and quickly search stuff, one page at a time. Thus, I use [Firefox Focus](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/focus) as my main mobile browser: it’s extremely minimal, it has built-in tracking and ad blocking and it’s blazingly fast~~.
- [Fennec F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.mozilla.fennec_fdroid/ "Fennec on F-Droid"), a browser based on [the latest Firefox release](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix "Fenix on GitHub") (codenamed [Fenix](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix "Fenix on GitHub")), and it has proprietary bits and telemetry removed. It works wonderfully.
- ~~[Firefox Send](https://send.firefox.com/), to send files up to 2.5GB, with server-side encryption. I hate to say it, but it’s not completely bug-free.~~ Project temporarily discontinued.
- ~~[Flickr](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flickr.android "Flickr on Google Play"), to access my photo storage. As of right now, this is also the only not-open-source service I’m paying for. I won’t lie: price ain’t that low, but it’s a pretty solid service~~. [[Piwigo|Switched to Piwigo]].
- ~~[Frost](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.pitchedapps.frost/ "Frost on F-Droid"), lightweight open source Facebook client for Android~~. I deleted my Facebook account.
- ~~I am not a music expert, definitely, but I am a music enthusiast and I listen to tons of different songs every day. I use [Genius](https://genius.com/ "Genius official website") to learn more about what I listen to and who wrote it. It is not open source but, again, there’s nothing as good nor even [comparable](https://alternativeto.net/software/rap-genius/?license=opensource) to it~~. Using it from the web.
- ~~[GitHub](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.android "GitHub on Google Play"), when geek attraction to software cannot wait for me to get back to my desktop~~. The web client is enough for activities seldom performed.
- ~~[GitJournal](https://gitjournal.io/ "GitJournal official website"), intended to be a note editor to be synced with GitHub, but I use it to update this website on the go.~~ MGit is more functional
- ~~[H20 Icon Pack](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.marcotls.icons.h2o.free), [look](/images/iconpack.jpg) how gorgeous it looks~~. No icons displayed anymore: I am [turning my smartphone a boring tool](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/turning-my-smartphone-into-a-boring-tool "an article by Maxime Vaillancourt")
- [Loop Habit Tracker](https://loophabits.org "Loop Habit Tracker"), to keep track of daily accomplishments. Feature requests and bugs are [here](/bugs#loop-habit-tracker "Loop Habit Tracker Bugs and Feature requests")
- [Hype](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.hype.app&hl=it "Hype app on Google Play"), the mobile client for [Hype](https://www.hype.it/ "Hype official website"). Proprietary software.
- [Hourly Reminder](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.github.axet.hourlyreminder/ "Hourly Reminder on F-Droid"), I often lose track of time and I get distracted very easily. This app helps a tiny little bit, reminding me time is flowing and I need to get things done!
- I can’t chat with God, but sometimes I read what he says. I use [iBreviary](https://www.ibreviary.org/ "iBreviary official website") to do it. Non-free software.
- [Image Editor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pcvirt.ImageEditor "Image Editor on Google Play"), not open source, but it’s free. I love it. Basically, it’s an Android version of Photoshop. You can do **anything** to a photo with it.
- [Imaging Edge Mobile](https://support.d-imaging.sony.co.jp/app/iemobile/), to import images from [my Sony camera](https://www.sony.com/electronics/interchangeable-lens-cameras/ilce-6500-body-kit). I would have said “quickly import”, but no, the process is itchy and annoying. Obviously, since the app is made by Sony to achieve this purpose, it is non-free software and I cannot find anything which works better. I’m bound to continue using it until I change my Camera brand (very unlikely).
- [IO](https://io.italia.it/ "IO official website"), a curious open source app to manage public services in Italy.
- [Jami](https://jami.net/download-jami-android/ "Jami Android page on Jami's website"), same as on Mac. Still hoping.

- ~~[K-9 Mail](https://k9mail.app/ "K-9 Mail official website")~~. It's old and it looks old. Switched to FairEmail
- ~~[Keepass2Android](https://github.com/PhilippC/keepass2android), same as KeepassXC on Mac.~~, replaced it with the following

- [Keybase](https://keybase.io/download "Keybase official website"), same as on Mac
- [KISS Launcher](https://kisslauncher.com/ "KISS launcher official website"), as in **K**eep **i**t **s**imple and **s**tupid. I friggin’love it. It has [[Launcher|a dedicated note]] in The Jar.

- [NewPipe](https://newpipe.schabi.org/), a clever solution to watch YouTube without having YouTube, thus, anonymously. It has also [a nice set of pretty interesting features](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe#features).
- ~~[Nextcloud News Reader](https://github.com/nextcloud/news-android), RSS reader synced with Nextcloud~~. Replaced by FeedMe.
- [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/install/#tab-mobile), same as on Mac

- [Nextcloud Deck](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/it.niedermann.nextcloud.deck/ "Nextcloud Deck on F-Droid"), it rarely works

- ~~[StreetComplete](https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete), to contribute to [OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org)~~. To be honest, I don't contribute to OSM; when I occasionally do, I do it through the web interface, from desktop.
- ~~[Super Tuner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.music.supertuner), a very ugly yet lightweight and working (it’s just what I need: stuff that actually works) guitar tuner~~ replaced with Cythara, which is open source

- Let’s say you’re at a party on the beach and you and your friends are using the same bluetooth speaker connected to your phone, but there are too many requests for you to add songs to your player queque and enjoy the evening at the same time. This is where [Zoff](https://zoff.me/ "Zoff") comes useful: you just create a room on the platform and you share its unique link with your friends. They can add the songs they want and they’ll be played seamlessly ithout you handling the “let’s play this song instead!” deal.

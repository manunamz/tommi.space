- [Adobe Lightroom Classic](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom-classic.html), alas, the best photo editing software out there. I hate Adobe, but it works so damn good. I’m doing my best to completely switch to the two following programs but, damn, it’s so hard. Also: I have to keep Lightroom on my device because it’s impossible to move photography edits committed with Lightroom to Darktable.
- [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html). I tried living without it. I couldn't. Hands down, it's the best visual editing software in the world. You could do anything with it.
- ~~[AEScrypt](https://www.aescrypt.com "AEScrypt") file encrypter and decrypter~~ I do not use it. If needed, same stuff can be done via CLI
- [AlDente](https://github.com/davidwernhart/AlDente "AlDente source code on GitHub"), a MacBook utility to avoid over-charging the battery when the device is plugged and it have reached 100% charge
- ~~[Android File Transfer](https://www.android.com/filetransfer/ "Android File Transfer"), the name says it all. It’s simple and it works great~~. I do not own an Android device anymore.
- [AppCleaner](https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner "AppCleaner") is not open source, but, damn, it’s so useful I have to keep it.
- ~~[Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/ "Audacity official website"), audio editing software. I know, I have Garage Band which is awesome but… Audacity works the same way anywhere.~~ I need very little sound editing, mixing, etc: GarageBand is fine; furthermore, it's neat, simple and quick.
- [Background Music](https://github.com/kyleneideck/BackgroundMusic "Background Music on GitHub"), to handle audio sources and audio recording
- [Backtrack](https://www.backtrack.team/ "Backtrack"), the Holy Graal for university students which get easily distracted (me). It allows you to recover audio up to 5 hours before. It’s not Open Source and I payed 2€ for it. Totally worth it.
- ~~[balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/ "Etcher"), the safest, simplest and quickest software to flash OS images to external drives.~~ I was not using it so much.
- ~~[BitBar](https://getbitbar.com "BitBar official website"), run any plugin from the top bar~~. I didn't use it.
- ~~[BlackHole](https://blackhole.run/ "BlackHole"), to share any file. Fast and private. Based on [Blockstack](https://blockstack.org/).~~ It’s useless.
- ~~[Blockstack](https://blockstack.org/), ideally, it’s something **awesome**, definitely game-changing.~~ Practically, it doesn’t work on my Mac (I tried <a href="https://forum.blockstack.org/t/cant-use-any-dapp/10628" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">everything</a>). I uninstalled and I’m not using it, then.
- [ChatSecure](https://chatsecure.org "ChatSecure"), a free and open source XMPP messaging client
- ~~[Cakebrew](https://www.cakebrew.com "Cakebrew"), Homebrew GUI~~, it is useless
- [Clean Me](https://kevin-de-koninck.github.io/Clean-Me "Clean Me official website"), an Open Source, better, neat and perfectly working alternative to CCleaner written in Swift.
- [Clipy](https://clipy-app.com "Clipy"), clipboard history logger
- ~~[CopyQ](https://hluk.github.io/CopyQ/), a clipboard history recorder, which keeps a record of all copied text and items. It saved my life several times~~. I like Clipy much more
- ~~[Cosmicast](https://www.poeticbytes.com/cosmicast "Cosmicast"), a minimal and beautiful podcast player which syncs with iOS through iCloud. It is proprietary software and it costs 3,50€~~. Definitely not worth the price: the app is buggy, it has a lot of problems and limits; I moved to Apple Podcasts… it syncs perfectly and it allows importing RSS feeds.
- [[Cubbit]] desktop synchronization client
- [Curiosity](https://github.com/Dimillian/RedditOS "RedditOS repository on GitHub"), a MacOS Reddit client
- [DarkModeBuddy](https://github.com/insidegui/DarkModeBuddy "DarkModeBuddy on GitHub"), a **must have**: MacOS theme changes from light to dark based on surrounding ambient light
- ~~[Darktable](https://www.darktable.org/ "Darktable official website"), widely used (still, not the first option for pros) photo editing software. I wish I’d love it but, damn, it’s so friggin complicated~~. Using Lightroom. I'm sorry, but it simpler, faster, nicer.
- [deadbolt](https://github.com/alichtman/deadbolt "deadbolt on GitHub"), file encryption and decryption made easy.
- ~~[Digikam](https://www.digikam.org/ "Digikam official website"), a photo management software~~. I don't have time to learn it and it isn't so essential.
- [dupeGuru](https://dupeguru.voltaicideas.net/ "dupeGuru"), a file (specially images) duplicate finder. It would be fantastic, but it does not work with more than 200 photos, for me.
- [DWAgent](https://www.dwservice.net/en/download.html?_request=main&page=download) by [DWS Service](https://www.dwservice.net/ "DWS Service"), a great, simple and lightweight VNC, thus a program which allows you to access your computer remotely from any web browser.
- [Element](https://element.io "Element") the most common and stable [Matrix](https://matrix.org "Matrix") client
- [Espanso](https://espanso.org/ "Espanso official website"), a wonderful text expander
- [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/ "FileZilla official website"), the best and most used [FTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol "FTP on Wikipedia").
- [Final Cut Pro](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/ "Final Cut Pro"), again, pricey and proprietary, but it’s so optimised for MacOS, thus so fast, that I really need it to edit with ease videos I need to have ready in a short time.
- [Mozilla Firefox](https://firefox.com "Mozilla Firefox official website"), the best browser ever.
- [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/ "Firefox Developer Edition"), to debug and improve Web Design and front-end Web development experience.
- [FreeTube](https://freetubeapp.io "FreeTube official website"), a private, simple, nice desktop client for YouTube.
- ~~[GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/ "GIMP"), photo manipulation and editing software. Better known as the Photoshop free alternative, it’s full of resources and it misses almost no feature, but it’s so so so messed up and confusing (as Photoshop is). Too much stuff in too many different places.~~ I tried as hard as I could, but it was too stressful. Back to Photoshop
- ~~[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/ "GitHub Desktop"), to easily manage stuff when GitUp and git from terminal do not make sense~~. Not really using it.
- [GitUp](https://gitup.co "GitUp official website"), the best GUI interface for git.
- [Get It](https://github.com/Kevin-De-Koninck/Get-It), a GUI interface for `youtube-dl`. Basically, a tool to download videos from YouTube.
- [Gifski](https://gif.ski "Gifski official website"), to create GIFs
- [GPG Keychain](https://gpgtools.org/keychain/index.html "GPG Suite homepage")</a>, to store and handle PGP Keys.
- [HandBrake](https://handbrake.fr/ "HandBrake official website"), anything you need to do with video files, it gets it done (in a short or eternal amount of time).
- ~~[Hidden Bar](https://github.com/dwarvesf/hidden "Hidden Bar official page"), to hide itchy icons from the menu bar~~. If the status bar is set to be hidden automatically, it doesn’t make sense to hide icons inside it.
- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/ "Inkscape official website"). Anything with graphics? Use this. I definitely love it.
- [iTerm](https://iterm.sourceforge.net/ "iTerm official website"), a feature-packed terminal emulator.
	- [Change theme following system theme](https://gist.github.com/jamesmacfie/2061023e5365e8b6bfbbc20792ac90f8 " iTerm 2 - script to change theme depending on Mac OS dark mode")
- [Jami](https://jami.net/ "Jami official website"), peer-to-peer unlimited video and voice communications. On paper it’s the go-to for everyone and I love it’s philosophy. Unfortunately, it still has a few bugs which make it impossible to use it regularly.
- [Jitsi Meet](https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet-electron), a video conferencing service which can be self-hosted. Since it should work only on Google Chrome browser, I installed the Electron-based app.
- ~~[Joplin](https://joplinapp.org), basically it’s just a note-taking application, but it has **anything else** you can think of~~. Switched to Obsidian.
- ~~[Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/), keyboard remapping. I use it to swap the `esc` key with ⇪, for a better usability in vim~~. It's too complicated to configure and even using [Goku](https://github.com/yqrashawn/GokuRakuJoudo "Goku on GitHub") it's a mess. `⇪` can be remapped to `esc` from MacOS settings, without the need to install anything else.
	- [Karabiner](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/macos/macos-apps/karabiner "Karabiner on Nikita Voloboev's Wiki") page on [Nikita Voloboev's wiki](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz "Nikita Voloboev's wiki")

- [Keybase](https://keybase.io/ "Keybase"), a great secure messaging service.
- ~~[LBRY](https://lbry.com/), the first digital marketplace to be controlled by the market's participants rather than a corporation or other 3rd-party. Basically, a healthier version of YouTube~~. I'm using [the web client](https://lbry.tv "LBRY TV") only, the app is not worth it.
- ~~[LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/ "LibreOffice official website"), the best open Office Suite.~~ for my needs, the default Apple office apps are more than enough. If I need a file in `.odt`, I export in `.docx` from Pages and I convert it in `.odt` with Pandoc.
- [LyricsX](https://github.com/ddddxxx/LyricsX "LyricsX"), a lyrics app which integrates with Spotify and Apple Music
- ~~[MacDown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com/), a markdown editor which has everything I need. I don’t use it much since I have both Joplin and Vim to open and edit `.md` files, but it’s very lightweight and it’s handy to have an app to view and edit them on the fly.~~ using MacVim + Marked 2, instead.
- [MacSVG](https://github.com/dsward2/macSVG "MacSVG repository on GitHub"), to create animated SVGs
- [MacVim](https://macvim-dev.github.io/macvim/ "MacVim official website"), a standalone [[Vim]] app for MacOS. pretty nice to edit files on the go.
- [Mast](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mast-for-mastodon/id1437429129 "Mast") is a wonderful, simple and neat [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org "Mastodon") [client](https://joinmastodon.org/apps "Mastodon clients"). Unfortunately, it is non-free software, in every sense; it costs 3,50€.
- ~~[MEGAsync](https://mega.nz/sync "MEGAsync official page"), the synchronization app for [MEGA](https://mega.nz "MEGA official website") Cloud service.~~ I'm not using anymore. Nextcloud + [[Cubbit]] only.
- [MonoFocus](https://monofocus.app/ "MonoFocus"), focus on one task at a time.

- [NetNewsWire](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/ "NetNewsWire official website"), the best [RSS reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_feed_aggregators "“Comparison of Feed aggregators” on Wikipedia") ever. I sync it with the awesome [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com "Feedbin").
- [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/ "Nextcloud official website") desktop client.
- ~~[OmegaT](https://omegat.org "OmegaT"), a translation memory application written in Java. I use it to translate [MDN](https://mdn.dev/) articles for Mozilla Italia.~~ I don’t use it that much
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md "Obsidian official website"), the best markdown-based knowledge management software ever!
- [OnionShare](https://onionshare.org "OnionShare official website"). Stop using WeTransfer! Use this.

- ~~[Openwhyd](https://openwhyd.org), an open-source platform to discover and share music. Basically, a Spotify alternative to save and share playlists~~. Nothing changes from the web interface to the app. I'm using it from the browser.
- [OpenVPN Connect](https://openvpn.net/download-open-vpn/ "OpenVPN clients"), the desktop client for [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net "OpenVPN official website"), which I host on [[Server|my server]].
- [PDF Expert](https://pdfexpert.com "PDF Expert"), PDF Swiss Army knife. Not open source and quit pricey, but it does its job very well. I got it with a students' 30% discount.
- [Plug](https://www.plugformac.com "Plug"), a [Hype Machine](https://hypem.com "Hype Machine") MacOS client
- [Pock](https://pock.dev/ "Pock official website"), to move the Dock in the Touch Bar.
- [Pocket](https://getpocket.com "Pocket official website"), save articles for later. It’s not Open Source but I use it anyway because it’s owned by Mozilla (and [I love Mozilla](/stuff#mozilla-italia) and I have so many pages there that transferring them someplace else would be painfully annoying.
- [Protonmail Bridge](https://protonmail.com/bridge/ "ProtonMail Bridge"), an app which allows me to access and use my ProtonMail account from Apple Mail.
- ~~[ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/ "ProtonVPN official website"), a security-focused VPN developed by CERN scientists from the ProtonMail team. It’s free, but I pay for it, it’s a great service~~. Switched to self-hosted OpenVPN
- [qBittorrent](https://qbittorrent.org/), the best and lightest torrent client you can find out there.
- [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/ "Rectangle official website"), a window management app which allows to resize windows quickly with a simple keystroke.

- [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com "Spotify official website"), to listen to music by paying and using proprietary software. Any legal affordable solution? I can’t find one. I’m stuck with this.
- [Sub It](https://github.com/Kevin-De-Koninck/Sub-It), a GUI interface for `Subliminal`, a tool to download movie subtitles ithout ads
- [TableTool](+++)
- [Telegram](https://telegram.org/ "Telegram official website"), WhatsApp on steroids. I wish the back-end software was Open Source, too.

- [Tor browser](https://www.torproject.org/), to navigate online completely anonymously

- ~~[WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/), well, you know it. Owned by that monster called Facebook and surprisingly free but, guess what? Proprietary software~~. If I need to check it from the computer, I do it through [WhatsApp Web](https://web.whatsapp.com "WhatsApp Web")
- ~~[Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/), fully-featured Markdown editing app~~. Switched to Obsidian
- [Zoom](https://zoom.us "Zoom official website"), you all know it. I'm not a fan and if it was for me I'd use [Jitsi Meet](https://meet.jit.si "Jitsi Meet") only, but I need it to access my university's classes.

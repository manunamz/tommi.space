I believe the foundations of a peaceful, productive and full life are composed of a combination of [[Loops|habits]] and [[Boundaries|boundaries]].\
Below are the ones I set to myself.

<div class="blue box">
	The following decisions go hand in hand with [[The Slot Philosophy]], which is my main approach to [[Self improvement]]
</div>

- from 2013, stop playing and installing games on my mobile
- from June 2016, turning off all push notifications, except alarms and reminders
	- you don't actually miss any message
	- you can leave internet and everything turned on, nothing will distract you unless really important and worth your immediate attention
- from 9<sup>th</sup> November 2020, never use my laptop while in bed, except to watch movies or series
- by the end of 2020, stop sending voice notes longer than 30-45 seconds
	- Either write or call. It's way better, most of the time.
	- communications becomes stressful: if I record long audios, obviously I need to listen to them… and they pile up. This is not good nor healthy.
- by the end of 2020, [quit Social Media](https://quitsocialmedia.club "Quit Social Media")

I believe the foundations of a peaceful, productive and full life are composed of a combination of [[Loops|habits]] and boundaries.\
Below are the ones I set to myself.

The following decisions go hand in hand with [[The Slot Philosophy]], which is my main approach to [[Self improvement]]

- from 2013, stop playing and installing games on my mobile
- from June 2016, turning off all push notifications
- from 9<sup>th</sup> November 2020, never use my laptop while in bed, except to watch movies or series
- by the end of 2020, stop sending voice notes longer than 30-45 seconds
- by the end of 2020, [quit Social Media](https://quitsocialmedia.club "Quit Social Media")

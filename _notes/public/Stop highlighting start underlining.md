Highlighting is strong, excessive, distracting, aggressive.   
Underlining is soft, neat, light, instead.

While ==highlighting screams==: <q>LOOK AT ME COME ON!</q>, <u>underlining</u> raises a hand and timidly tells you: <q>hey! Remember this!</q>

Highlighting is egocentric and annoying, underlining is actually useful: it catches the eye, but without stressing it with too many frills.

Underlining lets you focus on the content, which is what actually matters.

What about <span style="color:limegreen">colored text</span> or **bold text**?\
This is more a matter of [[Design]]

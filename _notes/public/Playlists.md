- *[[Xplosion Music]]* is the soundtrack of my existence (even if my life is not a movie and I am not [Truman Burbank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Truman_Show "The Truman Show on Wiipedia")).
- *[[Xplosion Music Extended]]* contains everything which is in *Xplosion Music*, plus songs that do not make it to my lifeâ€™s soundtrack, but I love them so much.
- *[[Classical Xplosion]]*, an explosion of classical music which makes me jump around graciously and move vehemently in the peaks of power (I cannot dance).
- *[[Metamusic]]*, music that talks about music.

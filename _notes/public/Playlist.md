<div class="yellow box">
	I'm trying to pursue the [[Ode to plain text|Plain text philosophy]] by stopping to use all of these hateful music players, specially [[Quit Spotify|Spotify]]. This Playlist is here precisely for this reason

## Premise

### Some explanations

Every song has a specific reason to be in this playlist, and I tried to summarize the reason for each song. I wrote the explanation of every song in its original language.

I worked hard to narrow down the selection to <u>only one song for every artist</u>, with very few special exceptions. I did it because I really wanted to identify the music which changed my life in some way or mark a milestone in my growth and evolution. A broader selection can be found in [Xplosion Music Extended](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3R9f7tk3sIFK7o0xBkLnIR?si=0J1rFLKYRGe7PwrrTy5J9g "Xplosion Music Extended on Spotify")

The list follows the alphabetical order of the artist’s name.

## Alicia Keys, <cite>Empire State of Mind</cite>

Do you remember [those old-looking mp3 players](https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2013/07/12/12/49/mp3-player-146314_1280.png "a picture of an old-looking mp3 player") with an integrated USB?\
Well, when my aunt gave me my first one as a gift, there was only this song inside.

<br>

## Alan Silvestri, <cite>The Avengers</cite>

I love Marvel movies. I actually get crazy before watching any new one. Avengers’ theme is the perfect representation of my hype and feelings about those awesome films. I can't help but getting excited AF when this track starts playing.

<br>

## Amélie No, <cite>Where Did You Sleep Last Night</cite>

This is [a folk American song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Pines), famous all over the world because of [the great performance by Nirvana](https://youtu.be/hEMm7gxBYSc). I love this one in particular because it’s part of the soundtrack of a wonderful movie I watched as a juror at Giffoni Film Festival 2018: [*Les Faux Tatouages*](https://www.giffonifilmfestival.it/sezioni-film-2018/4267-fake-tattoos.html).

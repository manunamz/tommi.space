The [[Apps]] I use the most are open source software in active development. Often, I notice bugs or I have ideas of possible improvements but I rarely have time to file a proper issue for every bug or a exhaustive post for a feature request. Thus, in this list I quickly note all the thoughts which pop up in my mind, hoping some day I’ll find enough time to effectively share my reports.

## Signal

[Signal](https://signal.org) is the most secure and private messaging app in the world

- markdown syntax (or any text formatting capability)
- setting to choose to automatically download media

<br>
<br>

## Obsidian

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is an awesome Zettelkasten management system which perfectly integrates with markdown and Jekyll.

- choose to hide front matter when embedding other notes, even if “show YAML front matter” is switched on for the notes
- printing all broken links

<br>
<br>

## Cubbit

[Cubbit](https://cubbit.io) is a great decentralized cloud. I'm among the first backers and I love it.

- Possibility to use a custom domain

<br>
<br>

## Oxygen OS

[Oxygen OS](https://www.oneplus.com/it/oxygenos) is the Android flavor developed and used by [OnePlus](https://oneplus.com)

- match the lock screen and ambient display design (right now digital clocks have two different fonts and sizes)
- add the capability to customize the alert slider

<br>
<br>

## Joplin

[Joplin](http://joplinapp.org) is a wonderful and complete note-taking app.

**Note**: I stopped using Joplin as my daily driver since November 2020 and I switched to [Obsidian](Bugs%20and%20Feature%20Requests.md#obsidian). The reasons why I did this are in [this blog post](/switch-to-zettelkasten)

## Zettlr

[Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com) is the best Markdown editor out there.

Since November 2020 I stopped using Zettlr since its work could be made by [Obsidian](Bugs%20and%20Feature%20Requests.md#obsidian) with much more features

Since the beginning of 2019, I've been shooting every 27 days at 12:11 PM my desk, without cleaning or uncluttering it. I'd just shoot a picture of how my desk is at a given moment.

Here I note all the explanations I give about this apparently nonsense and out of the blue decision, before maybe writing an article about it.

- Find a nice name
- a photo gallery as with Living Art



## explanation

I've always been one of those people who's never satisfied about how their room is

Every 27 days, no matter what, at exactly 12:11 PM I'll have to take my camera and shoot a photo of my desk. No matter what's on it or how is it. Just to immortalize my main life companion in that moment.

Literally, *metastudy* should mean “studying study”; actually, it signifies deepening the knowledge of how understanding, learning and remembering something works. I collect here some thoughts concerning <u>how to study better</u>, while keeping in mind that my considerations are strictly personal.

<br>
<br>

## Systems

### Where

Study in a public place or somewhere where there are other people; stay in a place where not studying feels much worse, where you naturally feel compelled to focus.

<br>

### When

There are morning people and night people. I am part of the former group. I can understand nothing if I attempt to study something after 7PM; on the other hand, I feel much more inspired and motivated if I set my morning alarm at 6AM and <u>commit to my study schedule from early morning</u>.

## MacOS

Right now on my [MacBook Pro 13" 2019](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP799?locale=en_US&viewlocale=en_US "MacBook Pro 13\" 2019 tech specs"):

- [Adobe Lightroom Classic](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom-classic.html), alas, the best photo editing software out there. I hate Adobe, but it works so damn good. I’m doing my best to completely switch to the two following programs but, damn, it’s so hard. Also: I have to keep Lightroom on my device because it’s impossible to move photography edits committed with Lightroom to Darktable.
- [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html). I tried living without it. I couldn't. Hands down, it's the best visual editing software in the world. You could do anything with it.
- [Android File Transfer](https://www.android.com/filetransfer/), the name says it all. It’s simple and it works great.
- [AppCleaner](https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner) is not open source, but, damn, it’s so useful I have to keep it.
- ~~[Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/ "Audacity official website"), audio editing software. I know, I have Garage Band which is awesome but… Audacity works the same way anywhere.~~ I need very little sound editing, mixing, etc: GarageBand is fine; furthermore, it's neat, simple and quick.
- [Backtrack](https://www.backtrack.team/), the Holy Graal for university students which get easily distracted (me). It allows you to recover audio up to 5 hours before. It’s not Open Source and I payed 2€ for it. Totally worth it.
- ~~[balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/), the safest, simplest and quickest software to flash OS images to external drives.~~ I wasn't using it so much.
- ~~[BitBar](https://getbitbar.com "BitBar official website"), run any plugin from the top bar~~. I didn't use it.
- ~~[BlackHole](https://blackhole.run/), to share any file. Fast and private. Based on [Blockstack](https://blockstack.org/).~~ It's useless.
- ~~[Blockstack](https://blockstack.org/), ideally, it’s something **awesome**, definitely game-changing.~~ Practically, it doesn’t work on my Mac (I tried <a href="https://forum.blockstack.org/t/cant-use-any-dapp/10628" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">everything</a>). I uninstalled and I’m not using it, then.
- ~~[Cakebrew](https://www.cakebrew.com "Cakebrew"), Homebrew GUI~~, it is useless
- [Clean Me](https://kevin-de-koninck.github.io/Clean-Me "Clean Me official website"), an Open Source, better, neat and perfectly working alternative to CCleaner written in Swift.
- [Clipy](https://clipy-app.com "Clipy"), clipboard hystory logger
- ~~[CopyQ](https://hluk.github.io/CopyQ/), a clipboard history recorder, which keeps a record of all copied text and items. It saved my life several times~~. I like Clipy much more
- [[Cubbit]] desktop synchronization client
- [Curiosity](https://github.com/Dimillian/RedditOS "RedditOS repository on GitHub"), a MacOS Reddit client
- ~~[Darktable](https://www.darktable.org/ "Darktable official website"), widely used (still, not the first option for pros) photo editing software. I wish I’d love it but, damn, it’s so friggin complicated~~. Using Lightroom. I'm sorry, but it simpler, faster, nicer.
- ~~[Digikam](https://www.digikam.org/ "Digikam official website"), a photo management software~~. I don't have time to learn it and it isn't so essential.
- <a href="https://dupeguru.voltaicideas.net/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dupeGuru</a>, a file (specially images) duplicate finder. It would be fantastic, but it doesn’t work with more than 200 photos, for me.
- [DWAgent](https://www.dwservice.net/en/download.html?_request=main&page=download) by [DWS Service](https://www.dwservice.net/), a great, simple and lightweight VNC, thus a program which allows you to access your computer remotely from any web browser.
- [Element](https://element.io "Element") the most common and stable [Matrix](https://matrix.org "Matrix") client
- [Espanso](https://espanso.org/ "Espanso official website"), a wonderful text expander
- [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/ "FileZilla official website"), the best and most used [FTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol "FTP on Wikipedia").
- [Final Cut Pro](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/ "Final Cut Pro"), again, pricey and proprietary, but it’s so optimised for MacOS, thus so fast, that I really need it to edit with ease videos I need to have ready in a short time.
- [Mozilla Firefox](https://firefox.com "Mozilla Firefox official website"), the best browser ever.
- [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/), to debug and improve Web Design and front-end Web developement experience.
- [FreeTube](https://freetubeapp.io "FreeTube official website"), a private, simple, nice desktop client for YouTube.
- ~~[GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/)</a>, photo manipulation and editing software. Better known as the Photoshop free alternative, it’s full of resources and it misses almost no feature, but it’s so so so messed up and confusing (as Photoshop is). Too much stuff in too many different places.~~ I tried as hard as I could, but it was too stressful. Back to Photoshop
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), to easily manage stuff when GitUp and git from terminal don’t make sense.
- [GitUp](https://gitup.co "GitUp official website"), the best GUI interface for git.
- [Get It](https://github.com/Kevin-De-Koninck/Get-It), a GUI interface for `youtube-dl`. Basically, a tool to download videos from YouTube.
- [Gifski](https://gif.ski "Gifski official website"), to create GIFs
- [GPG Keychain](https://gpgtools.org/keychain/index.html "GPG Suite homepage")</a>, to store and handle PGP Keys.
- [HandBrake](https://handbrake.fr/ "HandBrake official website"), anythin you need to do with video files, it gets it done (in a short or eternal amount of time).
- ~~[Hidden Bar](https://github.com/dwarvesf/hidden "Hidden Bar official page"), to hide itchy icons from the menu bar~~. If the status bar is set to be hidden automatically, it doesn’t make sense to hide icons inside it.
- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/ "Inkscape official website"). Anything with graphics? Use this. I definitely love it.
- [iTerm](https://iterm.sourceforge.net/ "iTerm official website"), a feature-packed terminal emulator.
- [Jami](https://jami.net/ "Jami official website"), peer-to-peer unlimited video and voice communications. On paper it’s the go-to for everyone and I love it’s philosophy. Unfortunately, it still has a few bugs which make it impossible to use it regularly.
- [Jitsi Meet](https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet-electron), a video conferencing service which can be self-hosted. Since it should work only on Google Chrome browser, I installed the Electron-based app.
- ~~[Joplin](https://joplinapp.org), basically it’s just a note-taking application, but it has **anything else** you can think of~~. Switched to Obsidian.
- ~~[Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/), keyboard remapping. I use it to swap the `esc` key with ⇪, for a better usability in vim~~. It's too complicated to configure and even using [Goku](https://github.com/yqrashawn/GokuRakuJoudo "Goku on GitHub") it's a mess. `⇪` can be remapped to `esc` from MacOS settings, without the need to install anything else.
	- [Karabiner](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/macos/macos-apps/karabiner "Karabiner on Nikita Voloboev's Wiki") page on [Nikita Voloboev's wiki](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz "Nikita Voloboev's wiki")
- [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org "KeepassXC official website"), A community maintained fork of the popular discontinued [KeePassX](https://www.keepassx.org/ "KeePassX official website") application with more features and frequent updates.
- [Keybase](https://keybase.io/ "Keybase"), a great secure messaging service.
- ~~[LBRY](https://lbry.com/), the first digital marketplace to be controlled by the market's participants rather than a corporation or other 3rd-party. Basically, a healthier version of YouTube~~. I'm using [the web client](https://lbry.tv "LBRY TV") only, the app is not worth it.
- ~~[LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/ "LibreOffice official website"), the best open Office Suite.~~ for my needs, the default Apple office apps are more than enough. If I need a file in `.odt`, I export in `.docx` from Pages and I convert it in `.odt` with Pandoc.
- ~~[MacDown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com/), a markdown editor which has everything I need. I don’t use it much since I have both Joplin and Vim to open and edit `.md` files, but it’s very lightweight and it’s handy to have an app to view and edit them on the fly.~~ using MacVim + Marked 2, instead.
- [MacSVG](https://github.com/dsward2/macSVG "MacSVG repository on GitHub"), to create animated SVGs
- [MacVim](https://macvim-dev.github.io/macvim/ "MacVim official website"), gvim for MacOS. pretty nice to edit files on the go.
- ~~[MEGAsync](https://mega.nz/sync "MEGAsync official page"), the synchronization app for [MEGA](https://mega.nz "MEGA official website") Cloud service.~~ I'm not using anymore. Nextcloud + [[Cubbit]] only.
- [NetNewsWire](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/ "NetNewsWire official website"), the best [RSS reader](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Comparison_of_feed_aggregators "“Comparison of Feed aggregators” on Wikipedia") ever. I sync it with the awesome [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com "Feedbin").
- [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/ "Nextcloud official website") desktop client.
- ~~[OmegaT](https://omegat.org "OmegaT"), a translation memory application written in Java. I use it to translate [MDN](https://mdn.dev/) articles for Mozilla Italia.~~ I don’t use it that much
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md "Obsidian official website"), the best markdown-based knowledge management software ever!
- [OnionShare](https://onionshare.org "OnionShare official website"). Stop using WeTransfer! Use this.
- ~~[ONLYOFFICE](https://www.onlyoffice.com/), the office provider I use, synced with [my Nextcloud instance](https://cloud.tommi.space)~~ LibreOffice is enough
- ~~[Openwhyd](https://openwhyd.org), an open-source platform to discover and share music. Basically, a Spotify alternative to save and share playlists~~. Nothing changes from the web interface to the app. I'm using it from the browser.
- [OpenVPN Connect](https://openvpn.net/download-open-vpn/ "OpenVPN clients"), the desktop client for [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net "OpenVPN official website"), which I host on [[Server|my server]].
- [PDF Expert](https://pdfexpert.com "PDF Expert"), PDF Swiss Army knife. Not open source and quit pricey, but it does its job very well. I got it with a students' 30% discount.
- [Pock](https://pock.dev/ "Pock official website"), to move the Dock in the Touch Bar.
- [Pocket](https://getpocket.com "Pocket official website"), save articles for later. It’s not Open Source but I use it anyway because it’s owned by Mozilla (and [I love Mozilla](/stuff#mozilla-italia) and I have so many pages there that transferring them someplace else would be painfully annoying.
- [Protonmail Bridge](https://protonmail.com/bridge/ "ProtonMail Bridge"), an app which allows me to access and use my ProtonMail account from Apple Mail.
- ~~[ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/ "ProtonVPN official website"), a security-focused VPN developed by CERN scientists from the ProtonMail team. It’s free, but I pay for it, it’s a great service~~. Switched to self-hosted OpenVPN
- [qBittorrent](https://qbittorrent.org/), the best and lightest torrent client you can find out there.
- [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/ "Rectangle official website"), a window management app which allows to resize windows quickly with a simple keystroke.
- [Signal](https://signal.org/ "Signal official website"), the best encryption system in the world, easy and fast communication, plus, it’s owned by a non-profit. Thus, a healthier WhatsApp.
- ~~[Skype](https://skype.com "Skype official website"), you know it. Proprietary software, [ouch](http://stallman.org/skype.html "Reasons not to use Skype, from Richard Stallman's blog").~~ Using alternative services only.
- ~~[smcFanControl](https://github.com/hholtmann/smcFanControl), Control the fans of the Mac to make it run cooler~~. Not used it once.
- ~~[Sozi](https://sozi.baierouge.fr), a presentation tool which uses SVG images to create zooming and panning animations. It’s astounding how cool it is.~~ Not much used.
- [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com "Spotify official website"), to listen to music by paying and using propietary software. Any legal affordable solution? I can’t find one. I’m stuck with this.
- [Sub It](https://github.com/Kevin-De-Koninck/Sub-It), a GUI interface for `Subliminal`, a tool to download movie subtitles ithout ads
- [TableTool](+++)
- [Telegram](https://telegram.org/ "Telegram official website"), WhatsApp on steroids. I wish the back-end software was Open Source, too.
- [Timer](https://github.com/michaelvillar/timer-app "Timer source code on GitHub"), sometimes it's quicker to set it from the laptop than from my smartphone
- ~~[The Desk](https://thedesk.top/), something like TweetDeck for Mastodon (and all of the Fediverse apps)~~. Never actually used it. The web client is nicer and just works.
- [TomatoBar](https://github.com/ivoronin/TomatoBar "TomatoBar on GitHub"), set simple working timers
- [Tor browser](https://www.torproject.org/), to navigate online completely anonimously
- [TweetDeck](https://tweetdeck.twitter.com "TweetDeck official website"), to tweet as bad as I can. Obviously, this is a very bad propietary software.
- [uTox](https://github.com/uTox/uTox "uTox source code"), a tiny, light super-private, peer-to-peer app to chat with my geek privacy-obsessed friends.
- [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/ "VLC official website"), to watch anything.
- [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html), when I feel a VPN isn’t enough.
- [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/), well, you know it. Owned by that monster called Facebook and surprisingly free but, guess what? Propietary software.
- ~~[Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/), fully-featured Markdown editing app~~. Switched to Obsidian
- [Zoom](https://zoom.us "Zoom official website"), you all know it. I'm not a fan and if it was for me I'd use [Jitsi Meet](https://meet.jit.si "Jitsi Meet") only, but I need it to access my university's classes.

<br>

- [git](https://git-scm.com/), a <abbr title="Version Control Software">VCS</abbr> no one can live without.
- [Vim](https://www.vim.org "vim official website") is the best text editor in the world, and it’s more than that; it’s a philosophy, a lifestyle. Actually, it’s preinstalled on UNIX-based OSs, but I installed [Neovim](https://neovim.io "Neovim official website") which is so great. I use it on a daily basis and I love it. See [[Resources#vim]] for learning material.

- [yst](https://github.com/jgm/yst), create static websites from YAML data and string templates
- [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/ "Pandoc"), a lovely swiss-army knife for document conversion. NOTE: I admire its genius creator, he’s a Philosopher developer whose name is [John MacFarlane](https://www.johnmacfarlane.net/ "John MacFarlane's personal website")

- ~~[AGESCI](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.devextreme.Agesci.App.Mobile), to manage and check my [scouting](/stuff#scouting) camps and activities~~. I don't need an app for this.
- [AndFTP](https://www.lysesoft.com/products/andftp/ "AndFTP official website"), to perform on-the-go FTP transfers to my server while. Not open source.
- [andOTP](https://github.com/andOTP/andOTP), [2FA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication) app

- [Banca Etica](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.bancaetica.bank "Banca Etica on Google Play"), internet banking for [Banca Etica](https://www.bancaetica.it "Banca Etica").

- [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com "Bandcamp"), mobile client for [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com "Bandcamp").
- [Barinsta](https://barinsta.austinhuang.me/en/latest/ "Barinsta official website"), a lightweight Instagram client for Android. You can't post from there, but you can search and view public stuff without having to login.
- Bible Study
- ~~[Blokada](https://blokada.org/), efficient and powerful ad blocker. It has some issues working with VPN on, still trying to fix it~~. Not compatible with VPN.

- [Element](https://element.io "Element") the most common and stable [Matrix](https://matrix.org "Matrix") client
- ~~[Etar](https://github.com/Etar-Group/Etar-Calendar), a simple, light and very nice calendar~~ it was a lie, it was old and I fear its development is discontinued. Replaced it with Simple Calendar Pro.
- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/ "F-Droid"), a [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software "“FOSS on Wikipedia”") app store. My aim is to quit Google Play completely and just use this; [[Road to Internet Freedom|almost there]].
- [FairEmail](https://email.faircode.eu/ "FairEmail"), the name says it all
- [Fedilab](https://fedilab.app/ "Fedilab"), an Android client to post to the [Fedicerse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse), I use it for [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) and [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org/).

- [FiLMiC Pro](https://www.filmicpro.com/), a super powerful app to boost video shooting from the phone and tweak as much settings as possible. I paid for it and it’s not open source, because -unfortunately- [there’s no app like it](https://alternativeto.net/software/filmic-pro/?license=opensource).
- I don’t care about bells and whistles while browsing on mobile, since I mostly read articles and quickly search stuff, one page at a time. Thus, I use [Firefox Focus](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/focus) as my main mobile browser: it’s extremely minimal, it has built-in tracking and ad blocking and it’s blazingly fast.
- ~~[Firefox Send](https://send.firefox.com/), to send files up to 2.5GB, with server-side encryption. I hate to say it, but it’s not completely bug-free.~~ Project temporarily discontinued.
- ~~[Flickr](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flickr.android "Flickr on Google Play"), to access my photo storage. As of right now, this is also the only not-open-source service I’m paying for. I won’t lie: price ain’t that low, but it’s a pretty solid service~~. [[Switch to Piwigo|Switched to Piwigo]].
- ~~[Frost](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.pitchedapps.frost/ "Frost on F-Droid"), lightweight open source Facebook client for Android~~. I deleted my Facebook account.
- I’m not a music expert, definitely, but I am a music enthusiast and I listen to tons of different songs every day. I use [Genius](https://genius.com/ "Genius official website") to learn more about what I listen to and who wrote it. It’s not open source but, again, there’s nothing as good nor even [comparable](https://alternativeto.net/software/rap-genius/?license=opensource) to it.
- [GitHub](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.android "GitHub on Google Play"), when geek attraction to software can’t wait for me to get back to my desktop.
- ~~[GitJournal](https://gitjournal.io/ "GitJournal official website"), intended to be a note editor to be synced with GitHub, but I use it to update this website on the go.~~ MGit is more functional
- ~~[H20 Icon Pack](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.marcotls.icons.h2o.free), [look](https://assets.tommi.space/images/iconpack.jpg) how gorgeous it looks~~. No icons displayed anymore: I'm [turning my smartphone a boring tool](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/turning-my-smartphone-into-a-boring-tool "an article by Maxime Vaillancourt")
- [Loop Habit Tracker](https://loophabits.org "Loop Habit Tracker"), to keep track of daily accomplishments. Feature requests and bugs are [here](/bugs#loop-habit-tracker)

- [Image Editor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pcvirt.ImageEditor "Image Editor on Google Play"), not open source, but it’s free. I love it. Basically, it’s an Android version of Photoshop. You can do **anything** to a photo with it.
- [Imaging Edge Mobile](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sony.playmemories.mobile), to import images from [my Sony camera](https://www.sony.com/electronics/interchangeable-lens-cameras/ilce-6500-body-kit). I hould’ve said “quickly import”, but no, the process is itchy and annoying. Obviously, since the app is made by Sony to achieve this purpose, it’s nonfree software and I can’t find anything which works better. I’m bound to continue using it until I change my Camera brand (very unlikely).
- [IO](https://io.italia.it/ "IO official website"), a curious open source app to manage public services in Italy. As of when I’m writing, it’s very new and I haven’t had any chance to use it yet.
- [Jami](https://jami.net/download-jami-android/ "Jami Android page on Jami's website"), same as on Mac. Still hoping.

- ~~[K-9 Mail](https://k9mail.app/ "K-9 Mail official website")~~. It's old and it looks old. Switched to FairEmail
- ~~[Keepass2Android](https://github.com/PhilippC/keepass2android), same as KeepassXC on Mac.~~, replaced it with the following
- [KeepassDX](https://www.keepassdx.com/ "KeepassDX official website"), password manager
- [Keybase](https://keybase.io/download "Keybase official website"), same as on Mac
- [KISS Launcher](https://kisslauncher.com/ "KISS launcher official website"), as in **K**eep **i**t **s**imple and **s**tupid. I friggin’love it. It has [[Launcher|a dedicated note]] in The Jar.

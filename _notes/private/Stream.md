## iOS improvements

### Messages

- Audio handling
- Delete for me / delete for everybody

<br>
<br>

## Timeline

Who I am is also, or mostly, defined by the events which marked my life even before my birth.

Timeline is the social network of timelines, on which anybody can share their personal timeline, choosing which events are private and which events are not.

Timeline is static, flexible, neat, minimal and simple: an `ul` of elements which are distanced proportionally with the time which separates them

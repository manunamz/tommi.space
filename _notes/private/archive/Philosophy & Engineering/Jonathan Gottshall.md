Itâ€™s telling and listening stories which make us human.

Often, different people see and understand different stories. Out mind makes the story differently from someone else while listening.

- **Addiction** from stories:
	- holy
	- sex
	- murders
	- dreams

Then **why** humans are so attracted and addicted to stories?

The firs answer which comes to mind is: to **escape** from reality and our busy and hard lives.

But there is a consequence: stories leave a mark in us, chenge our behaviour, involve us deeply. The spectator brain feels the same feelings of the character, as he is in the story.

**PHILOSOPHY TEACHER**:		TODAY'S PHILOSOPHY CLASS
					
						WILL BE BASED ON BLAISE PASCAL
						
						WE'RE GONNA QUOTE A FEW WORDS. FROM THIS FRENCH PHILOSOPHER
						


						*NOTHING IS SO INSUPPORTABLE TO MAN*

						*AS TO BE COMPLETELY AT REST*

						*WITHOUT PASSION, WITHOUT BUSINESS, WITHOUT DIVERSION, WITHOUT STUDY*

						*HE THEN FEELS HIS NOTHINGNESS,*

						*HIS LONELINESS, HIS INSUFFICIENCY,*

						*HIS DEPENDENCY, HIS WEAKNESS, HIS EMPTINESS.*



						WHAT PASCAL IS TELLING US

						IS THAT WE MUST ACT

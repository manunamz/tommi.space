Good morning dear friends,

most of you probably don’t even know me, but I feel it’s necessary and important to write you before leaving. I’m changing university, thus abandoning Engineering thus leaving this group. This course isn’t for me and I needed to study something which could make me more helpful for the world. Nevertheless, during the last year (only the first months, actually) thanks to this course I learned so much and I met wonderful smart people who I am now proud to call friends. This previous year, that most people would consider wasted, has changed my life and made me a better person, instead. My path is moving away from yours but I hope we will get in touch again.

May your life be an Exponential and not a Gaussian function.

With love,

Tommi

(I’m moving to Venice, will be happy if you gimme a heads up, we could meet)

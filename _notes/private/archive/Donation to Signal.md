Hello guys.

The following donation is my Christmas gift to all of my friends this year. Since I'm a student, I have no income, and this is the best contribution I can afford to give you and make it the most valuable gift possible. I am working hard to convert friends and family to Signal and I'll never stop explaining them its value and haw crucial it is to use open and privacy aware technology.

I love your philosophy and your way of thinking, as well as I strongly appreciate what you do and, most of all, that you provide a great, secure and open source service for free; this should be not taken for granted in the 21st century. This is why I chose, among all the others privacy-focused tech organizations, to donate to you.

I'd love to get in touch with you and discuss more about potential internships: I study Philosophy, International Studies and Economics at Ca' Foscari university in Venice, nevertheless, I have a solid basis of tech knowledge.

You can know more on anything about me by checking my website https://tommi.space

Thanks again,
keep fighting, we love you!

Best,
T

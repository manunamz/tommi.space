# Jojo Rabbit

- Moonrise Kingdom vibes
- "they could be just like us"
- "are you a teardrop specialist?"
- the hand getting out and closing
- childish simple complessness
- how the imaginary person goes away
- "someone must write a book about it"
- FRAMES - Wes Anderson
- the knife
- the making up
- THE ROMANCE - THE TIME
- the dance - the shoes
- THE GHOST

Diary writing as voiceover “excuse"

some day I'll / I don't care

cleaning and cleansing * (back seat, "street shower", rain)

"all my life needed was some place to go"

"filthy mess"

"they cannot touch her"

bubbles, sound confusion, all of a sudden from sul pesto to lost in the city
attempt to sell drugs

dialogues, nothing to do, totally out of the blue apparently, but then gets to a significant point
“i think you lonely” —-> “I think **you need something**” 

“she could’ve had anything she wanted”
I should … I will…

“there was an impulse that we were both following” “I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t”
PRESUMPTION / BRAVENESS

you remind me of…

CONTRADDICTION (as a word, as a fact)

th president should clean it up, clean all this mess… he SHOULD

episode with the bitch, DIRTY money

why the scene with the boys throwing eggs?

difference day/night

closeups, light change
focus of elements of the context focusing on subject and then getting back to it

“you’re only as healthy as you feel”

“she’s just like the others…” he becoming like the others
BOOOOM
immediately later episode with the husband

no answering… dialogue becomes monologue, looks become the true answer

other taxiers’ stories, normal stories lived as normal, travis instead normal stories lived as true stories

BACK TO I WANNA GO OUT AND DO SOMETHING but in a bad way
—-> 
wizard: **people are who they are.
That’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard.
what do you want i’m just a cabbie after all.**

body shape, “TRUE FORCE”

**craziness mania**

“here’s someone who stood up”

the broken tv?

making up the arming up by saving a prostitute

random elements seen more than once become the main thing later on

“he’s the scum of the heart”

turning around, going up and down of the camera (hug between iris and Matt)

“NOW I SEE IT CLEARLY, THERE WASN’T ANY CHOICE FOR ME”
haircut to enhance the look?

(statue arms up as the candidate ones)

# Sex Education

Most of the things in life are struggle. This TV Serie, blablabla

Basically, after S01, the whole point becomes waiting for those two
(Maeve and Otis) to get together. This is bad. This, I fear, is not
cinema. This ain't absolutely a nice thing. The whole purpose has to be
feeling, or sex, or people, or other even shitty stuff, but not a kinda
even pathological need.

(Netflix quality is shitty bad)

clicheous the thing about the headteacher's wife talking to Jeane

S01E05 & S02E04 prefers Maeve over a friend, then over her girlfriend

bella la scena in macchina con il pap√†, o, almeno, condivisibile.

Pretty useless or sort of misplaced/misdeveloped the excursion with dad
in the forest

bellissima la scena di lui che jerks off non capendo chi gli piace.

Emotionally intense and RIGHT the scene of Ola leaving Otis. Very nice
all the ones after.

BEING TOGETHER

STUFF GETTING MESSED UP when it all started so clearly.

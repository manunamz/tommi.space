What does it mean

What does it mean to love.

What does it mean to feel.

What does it mean to feel people, listen to them, share their thoughts,
embrace their feelings, focus on their expressions.

What does all of this means. What is the meaning or the puropose of the
existence of all of this?

Do we

Really

Feel it?

Nah, just a strange dream in a bad night' sleep

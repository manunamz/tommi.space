## Consumer surplus

<div class='box'>
	<strong>Consumer surplus</strong> is the difference between market price and what consumers would be willing to pay
</div>

The willingness to pay represents the individual interpretation of the value of a good. Every individual’s choice can be aggregated to form a demand function.

The individual consumer surplus is determined by the difference in price between how much an individual values a good and its market price, while the market consumer surplus is the sum individual consumer surpluses.  
Mathematically, it is the area formed by the triangle whose base is the quantity and the height is formed by the difference of the value of $y$ at the intersection of the function with the $y$ axis with the equilibrium price.

If the price falls, the consumer surplus increases, and vice-versa.

<br>
<br>

## Producer surplus


<div class='box'>
	<strong>Producer surplus</strong> is the difference between market price and the price at which firms are willing to supply the product.
</div>

The overall consumer surplus is calculated in the same way as the producer surplus.  
An increase in prices results in a rise in the producers’ surplus.

## Markets’ efficiency

The total surplus is calculated as a sum of the consumer and the producer surpluses and they are represented by the area at the left of the intersection of the demand and supply functions.

The consumers who buy the good are the ones who value the product more than its equilibrium price and the sellers who sell the good are the ones who would sell it at a higher price than they do.

Why markets are efficient:
1. The **property right**, which is gained by paying a price for it.
2. Price works as an **economic signal**, since it gives information to economic agents about how and how much a good is collectively valued.

Nevertheless:
- an efficient market is not necessarily a fair market;
- when market failures happen, markets do not maximize total surplus anymore.
- government interventions can reduce efficiency

<br>

### Fairness

Governments may intervene in the economy in order to increase equity, which does not correspond to equilibrium, as seen in [[Competitive markets]].

The Pareto efficiency states that resources are allocated so that nobody could be made better off <u>without making others worse off</u>.

<br>
<br>

## Markets failure

When a market is not efficient, something defined as market failure takes place.

Market failures could happen only in non-competitive market, which is considered to tend to reach equilibrium if there is no intervention only by liberals. In that case, market failures are considered to be **government failures**.

- According to the **Austrian schools**, <u>there is no such thing as a market failure</u>; imbalances have to be considered as opportunities for economic agents, and any sort of government intervention only does harm.
- According to the **public choice** school, a subsection of Political Economy, instead, government intervention <u>reflects the interests of bureaucrats</u>, hence producing further imbalances.
- Supporters of the **transaction costs** theory state instead that the state should not directly intervene in the economy and it should instead focus on reducing transaction costs.
- **Theory of the second best** supports that it is impossible not to have markets failure; furthermore, the overall efficiency of the system does not depend on how many markets are efficient. Solving a market failure in a market may cause a market failure in another one, since all markets are entangled.
- **Marxism** problems are not due to market failures but by the two cores of markets: private property and prices as economic signals.

<br>

### Causes

Possible causes of market failures:
1. **Market power** is related to oligopolies: there are very few producers which are big enough to manipulate and drive the market to maximize their interests.
2. **Asymmetric information**, derived from the fact that information used by customers to evaluate purchases is not equal among economic agents.
3. Imperfections and discontinuity of information
4. **Nature of the affected goods**.

<br>

### Market for “lemons”

Taking as an example an hypothetical market of lemons, together with a market of plums (higher value):  
while the seller has all of the information about the product, often the consumer cannot have all of the correct data about it.
Hence, the value $x_i$ of an ensemble of $i$ goods is mixed and the overall **expected value** depends on the single value and the probability $p_i$ to buy it instead the other similar products it is mis-presented for.

Expected value law:
$$
E(X)=\sum p_i x_i
$$

As a result:

1. Plums are out of the market;
2. Buyers are going to pay lemons for a much greater price.

All of the sellers, who have complete information about their products, are going to sell all of their lemons for a higher price they would actually cost if plums were not brought into the same market, while plums will remain unsold since sellers would never sell them at a price lower than their value.

Market failure, therefore, occurs because of asymmetric information which causes **adverse selection**: information is hidden before the transaction. If this could be avoided, plums and lemons market should be separated.

#### Solutions

There are ways to solve these kind of frauds, such as, trusted and verified sellers, anti-fraud legislation, and giving back products for free.

<br>

### Hidden action

A hidden action takes place through a **moral hazard** after the purchase: an example could be insurance, whose premium is defined by the risk of the insured thing or person; by lying about actual individual risks, I can pay a lower fee.

Insurance companies, hence, would receive less funds and they would tend to rise insurance prices, which would in turn make insurance not affordable for most people, and the only ones paying it would be the ones with a true very high risk.

<br>

### Externalities

The case in which actions of individuals have side effects on the welfare of other markets.

Externalities are external effects —benefits of costs— and they can be produced both in production and in consumption. Some action done to improve an economic process could later influence it even if it is not directly related to it. Externalities become fatal when they are not considered in a business plan. Nevertheless, externalities can be positive, too; education could be considered a positive externality since they have little revenue in the short term, but educating other individuals could be a great economical advantage on the long run.

The core meaning of externalities concerns matters which do not have a monetary consequence in the immediate future, but they could be influencing the business itself in a more remote time, by influencing other individuals in the meanwhile. Negative externalities create an external cost, while positive ones create external benefits.

The solution <u>does not lie in completely removing externalities</u>

#### Solutions

- By giving **private property rights**, in some cases, money should be involved as a compensation for a possible drawback of production.  
For example: an chemical industry throwing their waste in a river where fishermen fish, it would have to pay a fee to compensate the reduction of quality of fish, in the case the river was owned by fishermen.
- **Public** solutions:
	- **eiguvian taxes**: impose a tax on every unit of output, so that production by polluting companies is reduced. This would work even by giving subsidies to polluters in exchange for reducing pollution. Problem: government should have clear information of the relation between the level of pollution and the amount of output.
	- **emission fees**: taxes on unit of pollution, albeit it is hard to assess the amount of pollution
- by following **cap and trade** legislation, permits to pollute are assigned to privates and they are made exchangeable among privates.

### Merit goods


- Merit goods are goods which are underconsumed because their **private benefit** value is not objectively assessed by customers. Underconsumed products could be vaccines or cultural events;
- **Demerit goods** are goods which are overconsumed because their **private costs** are undervalued. Cigarettes could be considered as overconsumed goods.

Often, these kinds of goods imply externalities which are not correctly determined.

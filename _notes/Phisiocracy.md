Physiocrats were led by the french [François Quesnay], doctor to [Madame the Pompadour] at the court of [Louis XV], and author of the famous <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tableau_%C3%A9conomique" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Tableau économique on Wikipedia">Tableau économique</a></cite>. Its tables were the precursors of input-output tables used by post-keynesian scholars in order to develop the equilibrium theory adopted by the Neoclassical school.

## Meaning and purposes

*Phisiocracy* comes from the Greek _φύσις_ + _κράτος_, meaning “power of nature”; then it comes with no surprise that a great attention is reserved to agriculture. The contribution of this school to the economical thought can be understood by placing it in relation with the historical context of its epoch.

In the mid-XVIII century, France still suffered some problems such as inefficient taxation, obsolete production techniques, and feudal economic organization as a legacy of its previous bad government, and it tried to reach Britain, the true economic power of the time.  
Phisiocrats’ purpose was to take France out of its financial crisis and bring it to the economical position the UK had. They focused on three main points:

## Better agricultural productivity

Since agriculture played a key role in France’s economy, Phisiocrats studied a way to maximize its efficiency. This could be possible only by using more advanced farming machinery, which Quesnay considered crucial to bring cultivation to a larger scale. Nevertheless, better tools for agriculture could not be acquired since there was not enough capital to invest. It followed that capital accumulation was trying to be reached by introducing a price system able to guarantee farmers more profit and allow them to invest in newer machines.

## Pricing

Quesnay makes a distinction between:
- the **fundamental price**, corresponding to the **production costs**, which, for a farmer, are $p_{g}= [(w_{g} + m_{g}) + \delta K ] + R$, where:
	- $p_{g}$	:=	price of the agricultural sector;
	- $w_{g}$	:=	wages of the employees;
	- $m_{g}$	:=	value of the raw materials employed;
	- $\delta K$	:=	value of capital consumed in the production process
	- $R$	:=	annual rent paid to land-owners
- the **market price** ($p_{v}$) is the price observed in the market. Only if $p_{v} > p_{g}$ the farmers will obtain a profit to increase their capital accumulation.

Quesnay was concerned about the low level of market price in France, and its relevant oscillations, which were seen as very damaging since they discouraged farmers from long-term investments in fixed capital.

## The <cite>Tableau Économique</cite>

Quesnay’s <cite>Tableau Économique</cite> is arguably the best-known piece of the physiocrats’ legacy. It was published in several versions and it was considered as a forerunner of **Marx’s schemes of reproduction**, input-output analysis, modern national accounting systems, multiplier analysis and general equilibrium analysis.  
Its purpose was to show the conditions to be fulfilled in order to ensure the reproduction of the economy.

### Content

Society is composed by three classes:
- **landowners**, who live by gaining a surplus by the productive class
- the **productive class**, namely agriculture, which produces agricultural goods, and it is defined productive since it is <u>responsible for the surplus</u>, or the **net product**
- the **sterile class**, namely the manufacturing sector, which needs a quantity of agricultural goods to produce manufactured goods. This class is defined as “sterile” since the value of their output is considered equal to the overall value of the input.

The start of the analysis is the end of the production cycle +++

## Demand elasticity

A demand function is considered as elastic <u>when a remarkable change in quantity mirrors a drastic price change</u>. Mathematically speaking, the elasticity factor is related —but not equal— to the slope of the function.

$$
E^d = \frac{\Delta Q /Q_q}{\Delta P / P_p}
$$

where:  
$E_d$:= price elasticity;  
$\Delta Q /Q_q$:= percentage of change in quantity demanded;  
$\Delta P / P_p$:= percentage of change in price.

If $| E^d | < 1$, the demand function is inelastic, the price effect dominates the quantity effect: a large increase in revenues is driven by a large increase in price;
if $| E^d | > 1$, the demand function is elastic, quantity effect dominates over price effect;
if $| E^d | = 1$, the demand function is unit elastic.

Since the slope is usually negative, elasticity is often negative, too.

Estimating elasticity is important in order to obtain a reliable forecast of market outcomes.

### Determining factors

1. **Availability of substitutes** increases elasticity since customers switch more easily to a similar commodity, and vice-versa.
2. The **share of income** spent on the good influences how much a good feels cheap and how big the change is perceived to be.
3. The **time elapsed** during change

Price controls are legal restrictions imposed on prices.

<br>
<br>

## Price ceiling

Price ceiling is the <u>maximum price sellers are allowed to charge</u> for a commodity, usually below the equilibrium.

Economically speaking, generally price ceilings bear more problems than advantages, but they are imposed in order to meet social goals and greater equality.

<br>

### Side effects

- Tendency to create a shortage of the good
- Shortage, therefore limited and insufficient quantity, leads to inefficient allocation of resources which in turn tends to lower the quality of the offered commodity whose price has been constrained.
- Growth of black market activity

#### Deadweight loss

Deadweight loss is the <u>loss in total surplus</u> that occurs whenever an action or a policy reduces the quantity transacted <u>below the efficient market equilibrium quantity</u>.

The amount of surplus lost can be calculated according to the <b class="missing">+++ graph</b> below:

Furthermore, a portion of the producer surplus is converted into consumer surplus. Resources become misallocated.

#### Wasted resources

A black market easily arises, since the demand is higher than the supply, which could satisfy it, but not legally for the needed price.

#### Lowering quality

In the long term, since a high demand needs a larger amount of product at a low price, in order to force cheaper offers the quality of the commodity tends to lower in the long.

## Price floors

Price floors are minimum mandatory prices which result in a growth of surplus. As in price ceilings, the allocation of resources changes, but in this case less efficient firms are more advantaged.

- In the case of minimum wage, workers rights are preserved

### Side effects

#### Wasted resources

A growth of surplus results in wasted resources and goods which are not acquired. A common solution is for the government to buy surplus.

#### Black market

Again, controlling prices enhances the black market traffic.

Since most of price floors are **minimum wages**, a common consequence is for employers to illegally hire workers.

#### Unemployment

Since workers must be granted a minimum wage, their employers will have a minor possibility of hiring. As a result, who is employed gets a minimum wage, but some workers stay unemployed.

## Quantity control

- A **quota**, also referred as “quantity control”, is a quantity threshold set by the government for purchases and sales of a good.
- A **quota limit** instead, is the total amount of good that can be legally transacted under a quota.
- A **license** is the right to supply a good granted by the government.

As with prices controls, there are some drawbacks in applying legislation.

			<h1>WARNING</h1>
			<p class="page-description">
				It’s so funny to make it look like you just landed on a spam page. Don’t worry, it’s not (entirely). Here there’s a great collection of feelings, thoughts, notes, images and various stuff by Tommi Boom. Basically, this is the web representation of his messy mind.
				<br />
				Beware: don’t get too involved with the stuff around here or you may get as crazy and confused as him, which is definitely not recommended (that’s the reason of the initial warning).
				<br />
				Have fun!

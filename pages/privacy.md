I am not a lawyer and I know nothing about this topic, but as a user I am very concernet about these matters, therefore I believe it is important to write a <cite>Privacy Policy</cite> for this website, [tommi.space](/home "tommi.space home")

Actually, there is nothing to worry about. I collect no data from you.

Whenever you write me an email or you subscribe to the newsletter by clicking the box at the end of every page, I get your name and email address. It is not being shared with anyone; the only scenario which would obligate me to hand out your data is the one where I am forced by a legal action. I am going to promptly delete your data from my database if you request it.

Temporarily, subscribersâ€™ data and newsletters are handled with [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email "Buttondown"), whose Privacy Policy is [here](https://buttondown.email/privacy "Buttondown Privacy Policy")

What I'm doing right now:

## Quitting Social Media

I made a life-changing choice: delete all of my Social Media accounts by the end of 2020. There are a lot of reasons why I got to this point, and I discuss about this topic **all the time** with my friends. What I'm doing now is attempting to put together resources, articles, videos, documentaries and documents in [this website](https://quitsocialmedia.club). Randomly stuffed, everything is [here](/internet-freedom), for the moment.

## Planning a Festival

We have no website, no detailed schedule, no definite and clear structure. We are a group of curious, different and crazy guys from all over Italy and we have an idea, a place, a time: a **festival of meetings** (which is way better than is sounds), in **Sanremo**, in August 2021. It's already been one year since we're working on this and we founded an association. I'm its president (ðŸ¤¯).

Usually, I'd suggest to subscribe to a newsletter, or I'd point to a website, but as of right now we haven't anything like this. We're working on it. Keep in touch.

## Studying

I'm attending [Philosophy, International Studies and Economics](https://unive.it/pise) at [Ca' Foscari University](https://unive.it) in [Venice](https://www.comune.venezia.it/), Italy (One of the most attractive cities in the world).

## Projects, ideas, and collaborations

In the meanwhile, I'm continuing to wander around Italy to take part and/or assist to events and stuff happening anywhere. What's going on is [here](/stuff), and I [here](/tuttopiu) log everything (literally anything) I'm doing.

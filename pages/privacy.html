			<p>I’m sorry I’m no lawyer and I know nothing about this stuff, but I’m very concerned about this as a user so I feel like it’s important to insert this website Privacy Policy, too.</p>
			<p>Actually, there’s nothing to worry about. I collect no data from you. I just count every page’s views with Matomo. No link will track you and, unless you get in touch with me, I won’t be able to know you visited this website.</p>
			<p>About getting in touch: whenever you write me an email or you subscribe to the newsletter by clicking the box at the end of every page, I get your email address. It won't be shared with any third party service or person, the only scenario which would obligate me to give your email is the one where I’m forced by a legal action. I’ll promptly delete it from my database if you request it.</p>
			<p>The end.</p>

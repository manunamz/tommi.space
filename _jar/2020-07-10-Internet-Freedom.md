## Quit Spotify

Quitting Spotify is hard.

It's **very** hard, not only because it's convenient and easy to use, mostly because almost everyone else uses it, thus creating playlists, sharing music and interacting with other music lovers becomes way harder without it. Therefore, quitting and finding another tool to listen to music isn't enough: it's necessary to replace the playlist creation and sharing workflow while keeping it accessible and easy to experience for anybody.

1. Find the optimal [NewPipe](https://newpipe.schabi.org/) configuration.
	- How to listen to whole albums
	- How to like songs
	- How to import Spotify liked songs
	- How to improve bitrate (it's limited to 128kbps)
1. Copying Spotify playlist on other [FOSS alternatives](https://alternativeto.net/software/spotify/?license=opensource)
	- [OpenWhyd](https://openwhyd.org)
	- [Radio4000](https://radio4000.com/)
	- [Audius Music](https://audius.co/) (not a valid standalone option, it has its own limited music selection)
	- **?**
1. Liked songs?
1. [Spotify account deletion consequences](https://community.spotify.com/t5/Spotify-Answers/How-do-I-close-my-Spotify-Account/ta-p/4663172):

<figure><img src="/images/Spotify-close-account.jpg" title="repercussions of closing Spotify account" alt="repercussions of closing Spotify account" /><figcaption>Closing the account means deleting all playlists, thus the account can't be closed, but it must be kept with free subscription.</figcaption></figure>

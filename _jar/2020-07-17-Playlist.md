## Premise

**This page isn’t complete, it takes quite a long time to think and write a meaningful explaination of why I love a song so much to place it in this exclusive list**

### Some explainations

Every song has a specific reason to be in this playlist, and I tried to summarize the reason for each song. I wrote the explaination of every song in its original language.

I worked hard to narrow down the selection to **only one song for every artist**, except very few special exceptions. I did it because I really wanted to identify the music which changed my life in some way or mark a milestone in my growth and evolution. A broade selection can be found in [Xplosion Music Extended](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3R9f7tk3sIFK7o0xBkLnIR?si=0J1rFLKYRGe7PwrrTy5J9g)

The list follows the alphabetical order of the artist’s name.

Come potete vedere, non c'è ancora nemmeno una canzone. Ce la farò.

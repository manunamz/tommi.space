I’m planning to write a detailed and documented article about the ***how**s* and the ***why**s*, this is a simple schematic document with all of my notes and resources.

Unfortunately, I started documenting my progresses too late. As of right now I went through so many data, articles, videos, tutorials, alternative services, guides I’m definitely overwhelmed, and asking to my brain to remember my steps from the beginning may result in a mental breakdown.

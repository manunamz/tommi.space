<br>

## MacOS

Right now on my [MacBook Pro 13" 2019](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP799?locale=en_US&viewlocale=en_US):

- <a href="https://www.adobe.com/it/products/photoshop-lightroom-classic.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Adobe Lightroom Classic</a>, alas, the best photo editing software out there. I hate Adobe, but it works so damn good. I’m doing my best to completely switch to the two following programs but, damn, it’s so hard. Also: I have to keep Lightroom on my device because it’s impossible to move photography edits committed with Lightroom to Darktable.
- <a href="https://www.android.com/filetransfer/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Android File Transfer</a>, the name says it all. It’s simple and it works great.
- <a href="https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AppCleaner</a> it’s not Open Source, but, damn, it’s so useful I have to keep it. As an Open Source alternative, I’m trying to figure out how <a href="http://onnati.net/apptrap/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AppTrap</a> works.
- <a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Audacity</a>, audio editing software. I know, I have Garage Band which is awesome but… Audacity works the same way anywhere.
- <a href="https://www.backtrack.team/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Backtrack</a>, the Holy Graal for university students which get easily distracted (me). It allows you to recover audio up to 5 hours before. It’s not Open Source and I payed 2€ for it. Totally worth it.
- <a href="https://www.balena.io/etcher/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">balenaEtcher</a>, the safest, simplest and quickest software to flash OS images to external drives.
- [BitBar](https://getbitbar.com), run any plugin from the top bar
- ~~<a href="https://blackhole.run/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BlackHole</a>, to share any file. Fast and private. Based on <a href="https://blockstack.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Blockstack</a>.~~ not using it anymore
- ~~<a href="https://blockstack.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Blockstack</a>, ideally, it’s something **awesome**, definitely game-changing.~~ Practically, it doesn’t work on my Mac (I tried <a href="https://forum.blockstack.org/t/cant-use-any-dapp/10628" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">everything</a>). I uninstalled and I’m not using it, then.
- <a href="https://kevin-de-koninck.github.io/Clean-Me/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Clean Me</a>, an Open Source, better, neat and perfectly working alternative to CCleaner written in Swift.
- [CopyQ](https://hluk.github.io/CopyQ/), a clipboard history recorder, which keeps a record of all copied text and items. It saved my life several times
- <a href="https://www.darktable.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Darktable</a>, widely used (still, not the first option for pros) photo editing software. I wish I’d love it but, damn, it’s so friggin complicated.
- <a href="https://www.digikam.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Digikam</a>, a photo management software.
- <a href="https://dupeguru.voltaicideas.net/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dupeGuru</a>, a file (specially images) duplicate finder. It’s fantastic, but it doesn’t work with more than 200 photos for me.
- [DWAgent](https://www.dwservice.net/en/download.html?_request=main&page=download) by [DWS Service](https://www.dwservice.net/), a great, simple and lightweight VNC, thus a program which allows you to access your computer remotely from any web browser.
- [Expanso](https://espanso.org/), a wonderful text expander
- [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/), the best and most used [FTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol).
- <a href="https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Final Cut Pro</a>, again, pricey and proprietary, but it’s so optimised for MacOS, thus so fast, that I really need it to edit with ease videos I need to have ready in a short time.
- <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/exp/firefox/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mozilla Firefox</a>, the best browser ever.
- <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Firefox Developer Edition</a>, to debug and improve Web Design and front-end Web developement experience.
- <a href="https://www.gimp.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GIMP</a>, photo manipulation and editing software. Better known as the Photoshop free alternative, it’s full of resources and it misses almost no feature, but it’s so so so messed up and confusing (as Photoshop is). Too much stuff in too many different places.
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), to easily manage stuff when GitUp and git from terminal don’t make sense.
- <a href="http://gitup.co/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitUp</a>, the best GUI interface for git.

- ~~<a href="https://github.com/dwarvesf/hidden" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hidden Bar</a>, to hide itchy icons from the menu bar~~. If the status bar is set to be hidden automatically, it doesn’t make sense to hide icons inside it.
- <a href="https://inkscape.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Inkscape</a>. Anything with graphics? Use this. I definitely love it.
- <a href="http://iterm.sourceforge.net/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">iTerm</a>, a feature-packed terminal emulator.
- <a href="https://jami.net/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jami</a>, peer-to-peer unlimited video and voice communications. On paper it’s the go-to for everyone and I love it’s philosophy. Unfortunately, it still has a few bugs which make it impossible to use it regularly.
- <a href="https://meet.jit.si" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jitsi Meet</a>, a video conferencing service which can be self-hosted. Since it should work only on Google Chrome browser, I installed the <a href="https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet-electron" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Electron-based app</a>.
- <a href="https://joplinapp.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Joplin</a>, basically it’s just a note-taking application, but it has **anything else** you can think of.
- <a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">KeePass XC</a>, A community maintained fork of the popular discontinued <a href="https://www.keepassx.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">KeePassX</a> application with more features and frequent updates.

- <a href="https://lbry.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">LBRY</a>, the first digital marketplace to be controlled by the market's participants rather than a corporation or other 3rd-party. Basically, a healthier version of YouTube.

- ~~<a href="http://macdown.uranusjr.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MacDown</a>, a markdown editor which has everything I need. I don’t use it much since I have both Joplin and Vim to open and edit `.md` files, but it’s very lightweight and it’s handy to have an app to view and edit them on the fly.~~ [Zettlr](#Zettlr) took its place
- [MacVim](https://macvim-dev.github.io/macvim/), gvim for MacOS. pretty nice to edit files on the go.

- <a href="https://onionshare.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OnionShare</a>. Stop using WeTransfer! Use this.
- ~~[ONLYOFFICE](https://www.onlyoffice.com/), the office provider I use, synced with [my Nextcloud instance](https://cloud.tommiboom.tk)~~ LibreOffice is enough
- [Openwhyd](https://openwhyd.org), an open-source platform to discover and share music. Basically, a Spotify alternative to save and share playlists.
- [Pock](https://pock.dev/), to move the Dock in the Touch Bar.
- <a href="https://getpocket.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pocket</a>, save articles for later. It’s not Open Source but I use it anyway because it’s owned by Mozilla (and [I love Mozilla](#stuff#Mozilla-Italia)) and I have so many pages there that transferring them someplace else would be painfully annoying.
- <a href="https://protonmail.com/bridge/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Protonmail Bridge</a>, an app which allows me to access and use my ProtonMail account from Apple Mail.
- <a href="https://protonvpn.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ProtonVPN</a>, a security-focused VPN developed by CERN scientists from the ProtonMail team. It’s free, but I pay for it, it’s a great service.

- <a href="https://rectangleapp.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rectangle</a>, a window management app which allows to resize windows quickly with a simple keystroke.
- <a href="https://signal.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Signal</a>, the best encryption system in the world, easy and fast communication, plus, it’s owned by a non-profit. Thus, a healthier WhatsApp.

- ~~<a href="http://sozi.baierouge.fr/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sozi</a>, a presentation tool which uses SVG images to create zooming and panning animations. It’s astounding how cool it is.~~ Not much used.

- <a href="vim.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vim</a> is the best text editor in the world, and it’s more than that; it’s a philosophy, a lifestyle. Actually, it’s preinstalled on UNIX-based OSs, but I installed <a href="https://neovim.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Neovim</a> which is so great. I use it on a daily basis and I love it.
	- <a href="http://vimcasts.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vim casts</a>, the best video tutorials you can find
	- <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/dnvim2/practical-vim-second-edition" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Practical Vim</a> a book - the best book you can find - on Vim, by the same creator of Vim Casts: <a href="http://drewneil.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Drew Neil</a>.

- [ExifTool](https://exiftool.org/), an awesome and extremely useful little tool to edit almost anything in an image EXIF data. I use it to rename my images based on the date and time I shot them.

<br>
<br>

## Android

Right now on my lovely [OnePlus 6T](https://www.oneplus.com/6t) running [Oxygen OS](https://www.oneplus.com/oxygenos) 1.3.5.

There’s [a note](/launcher) dedicated to the [launcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_desktop_application_launchers).

- [AGESCI](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.devextreme.Agesci.App.Mobile), to manage and check my [scouting](/stuff#scouting) camps and activities
- [andOTP](https://github.com/andOTP/andOTP), [2FA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication) app
- [Blokada](https://blokada.org/), efficient and powerful ad blocker. It has some issues working with VPN on, still trying to fix it.
- ~~[Book Reader](https://gitlab.com/axet/android-book-reader), a book reader with a simple UI~~ Librera Reader is way better
- [BOOM](https://www.ultimateears.com/features/apps.html), to fully access my two [UE BOOM 2](https://www.ultimateears.com/en-us/wireless-speakers/boom-2.html) speakers’ features
- [Cythara](https://github.com/gstraube/cythara), guitar tuner
- [DAVx<sup>5</sup>](https://www.davx5.com/), to sync contacts and calendar with [WebDAV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV)
- ~~[Etar](https://github.com/Etar-Group/Etar-Calendar), a simple, light and very nice calendar~~ it was a lie, it was old and I fear its developement is discontinued. Replaced it with Simple Calendar Pro
- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/), a [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) app store. My aim is to quit Google Play completely and just use this; *almost* there.
- ~~[FairEmail](https://email.faircode.eu/), the name says it all~~, moved to the less complicated K-9 Mail
- [Fedilab](https://fedilab.app/), an Android client to post to the [Fedicerse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse), I use it for [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) and [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org/)
- [FiLMiC Pro](https://www.filmicpro.com/), a super powerful app to boost video shooting from the phone and tweak as much settings as possible. I paid for it and it’s not open source, because -unfortunately- [there’s no app like it](https://alternativeto.net/software/filmic-pro/?license=opensource).
- I don’t care about bells and whistles while browsing on mobile, since I mostly read articles and quickly search stuff, one page at a time. Thus, I use [Firefox Focus](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/focus) as my main mobile browser: it’s extremely minimal, it has built-in tracking and ad blocking and it’s blazingly fast.
- ~~[Firefox Send](https://send.firefox.com/), to send files up to 2.5GB, with server-side encryption. I hate to say it, but it’s not completely bug-free.~~ Project temporarily discontinued.
- [Flickr](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flickr.android), to access my photo storage. As of right now, this is also the only not-open-source service I’m paying for. I won’t lie: price ain’t that low, but it’s a pretty solid service.
- [Frost](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.pitchedapps.frost/), lightweight open source Facebook client for Android
- I’m not a music expert, definitely, but I am a music enthusiast and I listen to tons of different songs every day. I use [Genius](https://genius.com/) to learn more about what I listen to and who wrote it. It’s not open source but, again, there’s nothing as good nor even [comparable](https://alternativeto.net/software/rap-genius/?license=opensource) to it.
- [GitHub](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.android), when geek attraction to software can’t wait for me to get back to my desktop.
- ~~[GitJournal](https://gitjournal.io/), intended to be a note editor to be synced with GitHub, but I use it to update this website on the go.~~ MGit is more functional
- [H20 Icon Pack](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.marcotls.icons.h2o.free), [look](/images/iconpack.jpg) how gorgeous it looks.
- [Hype](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.hype.app&hl=it), money stuff. Proprietary software. (Nevertheless, an [awesome service](https://www.hype.it/))
- [Hourly Reminder](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.github.axet.hourlyreminder/), I often lose track of time and I get distracted very easily. This app helps a tiny little bit, reminding me time is flowing and I need to get things done!

- [Image Editor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pcvirt.ImageEditor), not open source, but it’s free. I love it. Basically, it’s an Android version of Photoshop. You can do **anything** to a photo with it.
- [Imaging Edge Mobile](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sony.playmemories.mobile), to import images from [my Sony camera](https://www.sony.com/electronics/interchangeable-lens-cameras/ilce-6500-body-kit). I hould’ve said “quickly import”, but no, the process is itchy and annoying. Obviously, since the app is made by Sony to achieve this purpose, it’s nonfree software and I can’t find anything which works better. I’m bound to continue using it until I change my Camera brand (very unlikely).
- [io.it](https://io.italia.it/), a curious open source app to manage public services in Italy. As of when I’m writing, it’s very new and I haven’t had any chance to use it yet.
- [Jami](https://jami.net/download-jami-android/), same as on Mac. Still hoping.
- [Jitsi Meet](https://jitsi.org/#download), video conferencing, same as on Mac

- [K-9 Mail](https://k9mail.app/), FairEmail was too complicated.
- ~~[Keepass2Android](https://github.com/PhilippC/keepass2android), same as KeepassXC on Mac.~~, replaced it with the following
- [KeepassDX](https://www.keepassdx.com/), password manager
- [Keybase](https://keybase.io/download), same as on Mac
- [KISS Launcher](https://kisslauncher.com/), as in **K**eep **i**t **s**imple and **s**tupid. I friggin’love it. It has [a dedicated note](/launcher) on The Jar.

- Let’s say you’re at a party on the beach and you and your friends are using the same bluetooth speaker connected to your phone, but there are too many requests for you to add songs to your player queque and enjoy the evening at the same time. This is where [Zoff](https://zoff.me/) comes useful: you just create a room on the platform and you share its unique link with your friends. They can add the songs they want and they’ll be played seamlessly ithout you handling the “let’s play this song instead!” deal.

## Nextcloud

Oh, I love [Nextcloud](/server#nextcloud). The apps I use on my instance are so many and so great I couldn’t insert a link to each and everyone of them. They can be found among many others in the [Nextcloud apps store](https://apps.nextcloud.com)

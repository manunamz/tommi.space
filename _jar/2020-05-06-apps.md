A comprehensive list of apps I use + apps I have to keep record of because I may need them, but not right now. Sub-elements in the lists are links to great learning resources (official documentation, if present, won’t be mentioned). Everything is free and Open Source, except where otherwise specified.

## Server

Services and apps self-hosted and running on my server, can be found [here](/server#installed-apps-and-services)

<br />

## MacOS

Right now on my MacBook Pro 13" 2019:

- <a href="https://www.adobe.com/it/products/photoshop-lightroom-classic.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Adobe Lightroom Classic</a>, alas, the best photo editing software out there. I hate Adobe, but it works so damn good. I’m doing my best to completely switch to the two following programs but, damn, it’s so hard. Also: I have to keep Lightroom on my device because it’s impossible to move photography edits commited with Lightroom to Darktable.
- <a href="https://www.android.com/filetransfer/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Android File Transfer</a>, the name says it all. It’s simple and it works great.
- <a href="https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AppCleaner</a> it’s not Open Source, but, damn, it’s so useful I have to keep it. As an Open Source alternative, I’m trying to figure out how <a href="http://onnati.net/apptrap/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AppTrap</a> works.
- <a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Audacity</a>, audio editing software. I know, I have Garage Band which is awesome but… Audacity works the same way anywhere.
- <a href="https://www.backtrack.team/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Backtrack</a>, the Holy Graal for university students which get easily distracted (me). It allows you to recover audio up to 5 hours before. It’s not Open Source and I payed 2€ for it. Totally worth it.
- <a href="https://www.balena.io/etcher/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">balenaEtcher</a>, the safest, simplest and quickest software to flash OS images to external drives.
- [BitBar](https://getbitbar.com), run any plugin from the top bar
- <a href="https://blackhole.run/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BlackHole</a>, to share any file. Fast and private. Based on <a href="https://blockstack.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Blockstack</a>.
- <a href="https://blockstack.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Blockstack</a>, ideally, it’s something **awesome**, definitely game-changing. Practically, it doesn’t work on my Mac (I tried <a href="https://forum.blockstack.org/t/cant-use-any-dapp/10628" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">everything</a>).
- [CopyQ](https://hluk.github.io/CopyQ/), a clipboard history recorder, which keeps a record of all copied text and items. It saved my life several times
- <a href="https://kevin-de-koninck.github.io/Clean-Me/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Clean Me</a>, an Open Source, better, neat and perfectly working alternative to CCleaner written in Swift.
- <a href="https://www.darktable.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Darktable</a>, widely used (still, not the first option for pros) photo editing software. I wish I’d love it but, damn, it’s so friggin complicated.
- <a href="https://www.digikam.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Digikam</a>, a photo management software.
- <a href="https://dupeguru.voltaicideas.net/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dupeGuru</a>, a file (specially images) duplicate finder. It’s fentastic, but it doesn’t work with more than 200 photos for me.
- [DWAgent](https://www.dwservice.net/en/download.html?_request=main&page=download) by [DWS Service](https://www.dwservice.net/), a great, simple and lightweight VNC, thus a program which allows you to access your computer remotely from any web browser.
- <a href="https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Final Cut Pro</a>, again, pricey and propietary, but it’s so optimized for MacOS, thus so fast, that I really need it to edit with ease videos I need to have ready in a short time.
- <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/exp/firefox/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mozilla Firefox</a>, the best browser ever.
- <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Firefox Developer Edition</a>, to debug and improve Web Design and front-end Web developement experience.
- <a href="https://www.gimp.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GIMP</a>, photo manipulation and editing software. Better known as the Photoshop free alternative, it’s full of resources and it misses almost no feature, but it’s so so so messed up and confusing (as Photoshop is). Too much stuff in too many different places.
- <a href="http://gitup.co/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitUp</a>, GUI interface for git.
- <a href="https://gpgtools.org/keychain/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GPG Keychain</a>, to store and handle PGP Keys.
- <a href="https://handbrake.fr/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">HandBrake</a>, anythin you need to do with video files, it gets it done (in a short or eternal amount of time).
- <a href="https://github.com/dwarvesf/hidden" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hidden Bar</a>, to hide itchy icons from the menu bar.
- <a href="https://inkscape.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Inkscape</a>. Anything with graphics? Use this. I definitely love it.
- <a href="http://iterm.sourceforge.net/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">iTerm</a>, a feature-packed terminal emulator.
- <a href="https://jami.net/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jami</a>, peer-to-peer unlimited video and voice communications. On paper it’s the go-to for everyone and I love it’s philosophy. Unfortunately, it still has a few bugs which make it impossible to use it regularly.
- <a href="https://meet.jit.si" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jitsi Meet</a>, a video conferencing service which can be self-hosted. Since it should work only on Google Chrome browser, I installed the <a href="https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet-electron" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Electron-based app</a>.
- <a href="https://joplinapp.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Joplin</a>, basically it’s just a note-taking application, but it has **anything else** you can think of.
- <a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">KeePass XC</a>, A community maintained fork of the popular discontinued <a href="https://www.keepassx.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">KeePassX</a> application with more features and frequent updates.
- <a href="https://keybase.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Keybase</a>, a new and free security app for mobile phones and computers.
- <a href="https://lbry.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">LBRY</a>, the first digital marketplace to be controlled by the market's participants rather than a corporation or other 3rd-party. Basically, a healthier version of YouTube.
- <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">LibreOffice</a>, an open Office Suite (but not Open Office, better).
- ~~<a href="http://macdown.uranusjr.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MacDown</a>, a markdown editor which has everything I need. I don’t use it much since I have both Joplin and Vim to open and edit `.md` files, but it’s very lightweight and it’s handy to have an app to view and edit them on the fly.~~ [Zettlr](#Zettlr) took its place
- <a href="https://mega.nz/sync" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MEGAsync</a>, the syncronization app for <a href="https://mega.nz" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MEGA</a> Cloud.
- <a href="https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NetNewsWire</a>, the best RSS reader ever. Unfortunately, it works only on Apple devices and it can’t be synced online.
- <a href="https://nextcloud.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nextcloud</a>, the syncronization app for [Nextcloud](/server#nextcloud).
- <a href="http://www.omegat.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OmegaT</a>, a translation memory application written in Java. I use it to translate [MDN](https://mdn.dev/) articles for Mozilla Italia.
- <a href="https://onionshare.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OnionShare</a>. Stop using WeTransfer! Use this.
- [ONLYOFFICE](https://www.onlyoffice.com/), the office provider I use, synced with [my Nextcloud instance](https://cloud.tommiboom.tk)
- <a href="https://getpocket.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pocket</a>, save articles for later. It’s not Open Source but I use it anyway because it’s owned by Mozilla (and [I love Mozilla](#stuff#Mozilla-Italia)) and I have so many pages there that transferring them someplace else would be painfully annoying.
- <a href="https://protonmail.com/bridge/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Protonmail Bridge</a>, an app which allows me to access and use my ProtonMail account from Apple Mail.
- <a href="https://protonvpn.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ProtonVPN</a>, a security-focused VPN developed by CERN scientists from the ProtonMail team. It’s free, but I pay for it, it’s a great service.
- <a href="https://qbittorrent.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">qBittorrent</a>, the best and lightest torrent client you can find out there.
- <a href="https://rectangleapp.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rectangle</a>, a window management app which allows to resize windows quickly with a simple keystroke.
- <a href="https://signal.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Signal</a>, the best encryption system in the world, easy and fast communication, plus, it’s owned by a non-profit. Thus, a healthier WhatsApp.
- <a href="https://www.skype.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Skype</a>, you know it. Propietary software, <a href="http://stallman.org/skype.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ouch</a>.
- <a href="http://sozi.baierouge.fr/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sozi</a>, a presentation tool which uses SVG images to create zooming and panning animations. It’s astounding how cool it is.
- <a href="https://www.spotify.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Spotify</a>, to listen to music by paying and using propietary software. Any legal affordable solution? I can’t find one. I’m stuck with this.
- <a href="https://telegram.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Telegram</a>, WhatsApp on steroids. I wish the back-end software was Open Source, too.
- <a href="https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TweetDeck</a>, to tweet as bad as I can. Obviously, this is a very bad propietary software.
- <a href="https://github.com/uTox/uTox" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">uTox</a>, a tiny, light super-private, peer-to-peer app to chat with my geek privacy-obsessed friends.
- <a href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">VLC</a>, to watch anything.
- <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tor Browser</a>, when I feel a VPN isn’t enough.
- <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WhatsApp</a>, well, you know it. Owned by that monster called Facebook and surprisingly free but, guess what? Propietary software.
- [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/), fully-featured Markdown editing app.

<br />

### Terminal

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), MacOS package manager
- <a href="https://git-scm.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">git</a>, a <abbr title="Version Control Software">VCS</abbr> no one can live without.
- <a href="vim.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vim</a> is the best text editor in the world, and it’s more than that; it’s a philosophy, a lifestyle. Actually, it’s preinstalled on UNIX-based OSs, but I installed <a href="https://neovim.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Neovim</a> which is so great. I use it on a daily basis and I love it.
	- <a href="http://vimcasts.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vim casts</a>, the best video tutorials you can find
	- <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/dnvim2/practical-vim-second-edition" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Practical Vim</a> a book - the best book you can find - on Vim, by the same creator of Vim Casts: <a href="http://drewneil.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Drew Neil</a>.

- <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fzf</a>, a fuzzy finder which works in some way with Vim but I’m still figuring it out.
- [massren](https://github.com/laurent22/massren), batch files renaming using a text editor (works great with vim). It’s developed by the same developer of Joplin
- [ExifTool](https://exiftool.org/), an awesome and extremely useful little tool to edit almost anything in an image EXIF data. I use it to rename my images based on the date and time I shot them. [Here](https://github.com/xplosionmind/exiftool-cheatsheet)’s my Cheat Sheet, which I use myself to get things done, since I don’t remember ExifTool commands from time to time.
- [yst](https://github.com/jgm/yst), create static websites from YAML data and string templates

## Mobile

Right now on my lovely [OnePlus 6T](https://www.oneplus.com/6t) with [Oxygen OS](https://www.oneplus.com/oxygenos) 1.3.2.

There’s [a note](/launcher) dedicated to the [launcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_desktop_application_launchers).

- [AGESCI](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.devextreme.Agesci.App.Mobile), to manage and check my [scouting](/stuff#scouting) camps and activities
- [andOTP](https://github.com/andOTP/andOTP), [2FA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication) app
- [BOOM](https://www.ultimateears.com/features/apps.html), to fully access my two [UE BOOM 2]() speakers’ features
- [DAVx<sup>5</sup>](https://www.davx5.com/), to sync contacts and calendar with [WebDAV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV)
- [Etar](https://github.com/Etar-Group/Etar-Calendar), a simple, light and very nice calendar
- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/), a [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) app store. My aim is to quit Google Play completely and just use this; *almost* there.
- [FairEmail](https://email.faircode.eu/), the name says it all
- [FiLMiC Pro](https://www.filmicpro.com/), a super powerful app to boost video shooting from the phone and tweak as much settings as possible. I paid for it and it’s not open source, because -unfortunately- [there’s no app like it](https://alternativeto.net/software/filmic-pro/?license=opensource).
- I don’t care about bells and whistles while browsing on mobile, since I mostly read articles and quickly search stuff, one page at a time. Thus, I use [Firefox Focus](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/focus) as my main mobile browser: it’s extremely minimal, it has biult-in tracking and ad blocking and it’s blazingly fast.
- [Firefox Send](https://send.firefox.com/), to send files up to 2.5GB, with server-side encryption. I hate to say it, but it’s not completely bug-free.
- [Flickr](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flickr.android), to access my photo storage. As of right now, this is also the only not-open-source service I’m paying for. I won’t lie: priceain’t that low, but it’s a pretty solid service.
- I’m not a music expert, definitely, but I am a music enthusiast and I listen to tons of different songs every day. I use [Genius](https://genius.com/) to learn more about what I listen to and who wrote it. It’s not open source but, again, there’s nothing as good nor even [comparable](https://alternativeto.net/software/rap-genius/?license=opensource) to it.
- [H20 Icon Pack](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.marcotls.icons.h2o.free), [look](/images/iconpack.jpg) how gorgeous it looks.
- [Hype](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.hype.app&hl=it), money stuff. Propietary software. (Nevertheless, an [awesome service](https://www.hype.it/))
- I can’t chat with God, but somethimes I read what he said. I use [iBreviary](http://www.ibreviary.org/) to do it. Non-free software.
- [Imaging Edge Mobile](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sony.playmemories.mobile), to import images from [my Sony camera](https://www.sony.com/electronics/interchangeable-lens-cameras/ilce-6500-body-kit). I hould’ve said “quickly import”, but no, the process is itchy and annoying. Obviously, since the app is made by Sony to achieve this purpose, it’s nonfree software and I can’t find anything which works better. I’m bound to continue using it until I change my Camera brand (very unlikely).
- [io.it](https://io.italia.it/), a curious open source app to manage public services in Italy. As of when I’m writing, it’s very new and I haven’t had any chance to use it yet.
- [Jami](https://jami.net/download-jami-android/), same as on Mac. Still hoping.
- [Jitsi Meet](https://jitsi.org/#download), video conferencing, same as on Mac
- [Joplin](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.cozic.joplin), same as on Mac, but here it isn’t customizable, thus unsolvably crap.

- [KeepassDX](https://www.keepassdx.com/), password manager
- [Keybase](https://keybase.io/download), same as on Mac
- [KISS Launcher](https://kisslauncher.com/), as in **K**eep **i**t **s**imple and **s**tupid. I friggin’love it. It has [a dedicated note](/launcher) on The Jar.

- [MEGA](https://github.com/meganz/android), same as on Mac
- [NewPipe](https://newpipe.schabi.org/), a clever solution to watch YouTube without having YouTube, thus, anonimously. It has also [a nice set of pretty interesting features](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe#features).
- [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/install/#tab-mobile), same as on Mac
- [ONLYOFFICE](https://www.onlyoffice.com/office-for-android.aspx), same as on Mac
- [Open Note Scanner](https://github.com/ctodobom/OpenNoteScanner), a simple and intuitive app to scan documents
- [OpenKeychain](https://www.openkeychain.org/), to manage PGP keys. It works hand in hand with FairEmail
- [OsmAnd+](https://osmand.net/), a great Google Maps alternative, based on [OpenStreetMap]()

- [Reddit](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reddit.frontpage), Reddit
- When I hear a new song I enjoy but I don’t know, I use [Shazam](https://www.shazam.com/) to tell me its title. Propietary software, [no alternatives](https://alternativeto.net/software/shazam/?license=opensource)
- [Signal](https://signal.org/install/), same as on Mac, even if it’s meant for mobile use.
- [Spotify](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spotify.music), same as on Mac
- [Super Tuner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.music.supertuner), a very ugly yet lightweight and working (it’s just what I need: stuff that actually works) guitar tuner
- [Ultimate Guitar Tabs](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ultimateguitar.tabs), to access [Ultimate Guitar](https://ultimate-guitar.com) from mobile

## Nextcloud

Oh, I love [Nextcloud](/server#nextcloud). The apps I use on my instance are so many and so great I couldn’t insert a link to each and everyone of them. They can be found among many others in the [Nextcloud apps store](https://apps.nextcloud.com)

Eventually, <a href="https://youtu.be/FtNxKc8mKu8" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a little message</a>.

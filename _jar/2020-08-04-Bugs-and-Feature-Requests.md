description: "I use mostly open source apps in active developement. Often, I notice bugs or I have ideas of possible improvements but I rarely have time to file a proper issue for every bug or a complete blog post for a feature request. Thus, in this list I quickly note all the toughts which pop up in my mind, hoping some day I’ll find enough time to effectively share my reports."

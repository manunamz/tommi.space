### 30 May 2020

I was writing the list of the [apps on my Android phone](/apps#mobile) and I got to the point where I had to add [Nova Launcher]().

One thing struck me: since when I got my first phone (2013) up to now (mid-2020) I’ve always used it. It’s been so good I also bought [Nova Launcher Prime](), and I never changed my mind. It’s most likely the (not pre-installed) app I used for the longest time.

I was ready to add Nova to the list, when one thought stopped me: “wait, is it open source?” so, I reached the official website an checked: [it isn’t](http://novalauncher.com/).

Out of pure curiosity, I went on [AlternativeTo](https://alternativeto.net/software/nova-launcher/?license=opensource) to know more about existing open source launchers for Android and, to my great surprise, there were some really interesting ones. Each one of them has a unique or very clever feature which makes me want to switch to it. Therefore, I decided I’d adopt one of them. I feel a bit bad about dropping the good old Nova Launcher without many regrets, but... it was about time.

Here’s the launchers (in alphbetical order):

- [KISS Launcher](https://kisslauncher.com/), as in **K**eep **It** **S**oft and **S**imple. it attracts me because it’s **very** lightweight and it has a simple search bar you can use to do anything or go anywhere
- [Lawnchair](https://lawnchair.app/), which seems the one with the biggest team and community behind. Also: a great design
- [Slim Launcher](https://github.com/sduduzog/slim-launcher), a bare-bones one with pure simplicity
- [T-UI](https://github.com/fAndreuzzi/TUI-ConsoleLauncher), I need to test it to really get how it works, but it seems like the whole launcher is replaced by some sort of Linux CLI. **Wow**.

I’ll dig more in depth to understand how they works and which one suits my needs in the best way and I’ll come back in a few days with my verdict.

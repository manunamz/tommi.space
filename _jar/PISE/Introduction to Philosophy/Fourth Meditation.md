# Descartes' Fourth Meditation

*Truth and falsity*

If God is not a deceiver, why does the error exist?

---

## Synopsis

1. God is not a deceiver
1. My faculty of judgment is a good instrument
1. I err because I'm limited
1. The universe must be considered as a whole \[\[+++ Agostino \]\]
1. Intellect is good in itself
1. My will is infinite

According to some scholars, the last meditation Descartes wrote.

According to Descartes, since God is both good and supremely powerful, God provided me with all the good instruments to understand without being fooled.

the fact that I'm limited causes error. Nevertheless, being limited is not a problem; it's a limitation, I'm deprived of something I'm supposed to have. Hence, error is the lack of something; it's not something which depends on God, or it would mean that God didn't give me something to reason correctly

+++ intellect is good in itself

Will is good in itself, too. Furthermore, **my will is infinite**

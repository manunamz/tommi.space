description: "I conceive knowledge as the fundamental quality of human life. It should be searched, managed, and preserved as a treasure, since it is the most valuable capability we have, together with love. Here, I collect <strong><em>meta-knowledge</em></strong> data, or better <em>Epistemology</em> annotations, which are knowledge insights about knowledge itself, and how to deal with it."

### Zettelkasten

Zettelkasten is a system/tool used by [Niklas Luhmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann). I use it for university notes, mainly, through [Zettlr](https://zettlr.com). Some infos:

Every topic should have its namesake counterpart in the [knowledge](./knowledge) page, with a link to the resources I took advantage of to learn it.

<strong>LEGEND</strong>:<br />
&#x1F9B4;: bare-bones knowledge<br />
&#128187;: self-taught<br />
&#128640;: something I’m proud of<br />
&#128064;: still looking into it<br />
&#128218;: learnt at university or High School
</div>

Listing all this stuff is quite a long and boring thing to do, so I started, but I realised I don’t have time to complete it. I’m just gonna leave it here and add a new bunch of data from time to time.

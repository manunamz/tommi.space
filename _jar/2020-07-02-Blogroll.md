A website appears in this list for at least one of these three reasons:

1. I admire its creator and/or author and/or owner
2. its design is great and it may have inspired [my own website](/home)
3. it has a particular unique or brilliant feature

<br />

Listed in alphabetical order. I could never determine an order of importance.

- [Backpackerz: rewind 2010s](https://thebackpackerz.com/special/rewind/2010/), the precursor of the new generation of “longreads” (a.k.a.: articles which take a lot of time to be read and written)
- [Born Free Generation](https://www.bornfreegeneration.com/), transforming a short movie, a story, in a website, done the right way. Genuinely beautiful.
- [Cafundó Academy Blog](https://cafundoestudio.com.br/blog/), those GIFs
- [CANALS](https://canals-amsterdam.nl/), a digital exhibit which travels through the history of Amsterdam’s canals
- [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org), arguably, the best website (for content, structure and ispiration) in this list
- [Once Upon a Time Magazine](https://www.onceuponatimemag.com), some sort of web magazine on [Once Upon a Time in Hollywood](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7131622/) by Quentin Tarantino. This website is astounding, it left me open-mouthed, it’s a great work and it feels so good: it’s a piece of art, literally.
- [Tim Holman](http://tholman.com/): this man is the perfect stereotype of the crazy, eccentric and hilarious geek. Parts of me want to be like him. Creations inside this website are madly clever.
    - [tholman/tholman.com](https://github.com/tholman/tholman.com)
    - [tholman/inspiring-online](https://github.com/tholman/inspiring-online)
- [Tania Rascia](https://taniarascia.com): the author has a great story, but the thing I love the most is the clean, minimal, neat design and layout. You get what you’re looking for in no time.
- [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org): there’s so much content and wit, so many insights, pages and links it makes anyone browsing around get crazy. I like it a lot. Also, but more importantly: this guy is so cool
- [Luke Smith](https://lukesmith.xyz/), gosh, what an individual. I love his philosophy about the internet. His website is here because of his [personal library page](https://lukesmith.xyz/library)
- [Trax Magazine](https://www.traxmag.com/). Let’s be honest: in the end every online magazine / news website looks the same. This one has a unique identity, great colors and a wonderful design, which doesn’t jeopardize readability and focus
- [UX Essays](https://essays.uxdesign.cc/), every blog should be like this
- [Work Responsibly](https://www.workresponsibly.org/), I can’t believe something so minimal can be so beautiful

<br />

## Photography

Photography websites deserve a dedicated section, since their content takes up more than in other type of websites

- [Antonio Masiello](https://antoniomasiello.portfoliobox.net/)

<br />

## Awards

Websites which award other websites for their design, usability, creativity and responsiveness

- [Awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/)
- [WebDesign Inspiration](https://www.webdesign-inspiration.com)
- [Siteinspire](https://www.siteinspire.com/)

<br />

## Various

Websites that aren’t here because of one of the reasons at the top, but I don’t want to forget them

- [The Useless Web](https://theuselessweb.com/), just click on it
- [Blank Website](http://www.blankwebsite.com/)

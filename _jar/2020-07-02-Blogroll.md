Alphabetical order. I could never determine an order of importance.

- [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org): there’s so much content and wit, so many insights, pages and links it makes anyone browsing around get crazy. I like it a lot. Also, but more importantly: this guy is so cool
- [Tania Rascia](https://taniarascia.com): the author has a great story, but the thing I love the most is the clean, minimal, neat design and layout. You get what you’re looking for in no time.

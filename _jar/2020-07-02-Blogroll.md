Mainly, a website in this list is there for at least one of these three reasons:
1. I admire its creator and/or author and/or owner
2. its design is great and it may have inspired my own ([xplosionmind](/home))
3. it has a unique or brilliant feature

<br />

Listed in alphabetical order. I could never determine an order of importance.

- [Tim Holman](http://tholman.com/): this man is the perfect stereotype of the crazy, eccentric and hilarious geek. Parts of me want to be like him. Creations inside this website are madly clever.
- [Tania Rascia](https://taniarascia.com): the author has a great story, but the thing I love the most is the clean, minimal, neat design and layout. You get what you’re looking for in no time.
- [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org): there’s so much content and wit, so many insights, pages and links it makes anyone browsing around get crazy. I like it a lot. Also, but more importantly: this guy is so cool
- [Luke Smith](https://lukesmith.xyz/), gosh, what an individual. I love his philosophy about the internet. His website is here because of his [personal library page](https://lukesmith.xyz/library)

## We are leaving proprietary social networks because

### They profile us

Every action we perform on social media platforms is recorded, stored, and analyzed to understand how we react to content, what we like and what makes us angry. Basically, who manages these platforms can use algorithms to **understand who we are**.

<br />

### They may know more than we know they know

Unless we ask them to, nothing is ever deleted, on propietary social media platforms. Even when we do ask for our data to be deleted, we can never be sure everything they have about us is actually gone. Thanks to the GDPR regulations, we can request the complete erasure and portability of our data on a platform, but we have no way to know if there’s more. If from the raw data collected while we were using a platform was built a  has been parsed refined details about our personality, we will never get access or erase that, because it’s not, strictly speaking, what we actually published on social media platforms. 

<br />

### They don’t forget

After a handful of likes, take 100 or 500, someone may have an idea of what are the interests and what’s the personality of someone. Algorithms, though, aren’t human, and they remember our first like as clearly as the last one and as the thousands of reactions we dropped here and there over time. They don’t forget, and they use anything in their power to know more about us.

<br />

### They use us to earn money and gain power

All of the data collected on us isn’t just used by social media platforms owners. The main purpose of their collection is to **sell them** to advertisers and advertising companies, which pay a high price to be sure their ads are seen by users who are most likely to buy them. Our name and generalities are stripped away, and our “anonymized identity” is sold to anyone interested in showing us ads which are “relevant” to us. The more we use them, the more they know us and the more they earn.

The problem is we will never be 100% that this data isn’t or won’t be used to other purposes, such as military and politic ones. In this case, from uncomfortable ads targeting, this would become actual manipulation.

<br />

### They constrain us in a bubble

By watching, studying and knowing us, social media platforms know also our interests, so they do their best to show us content that keeps us glued to the screen and engourage us to go on scrolling and browsing on the platform. The more time we spend on their platform, the more ads we see, the more they earn. This is why when we look for something or wander in the “explore” section of any proprietary social media platform, they just show us what’s more “relevant” to us, by cross-checking what we’re looking for with what we’re usually interested in.

Et voilà: we£re trapped in the bubble of our “interests” which can’t be defined by us, but by a robot that monitors our actions and decides them on our behalf

<br />

<!-- ### They 

While wandering around the “explore” section of any proprietary social media platforms we will never see what we are looking for, we scrroll through what we want them to look for. Since they (pretend to) know us and our interests, they just show us what’s more “relevant” to us,

### They won’t tell us how they work

<br />

### They are addictive

<br />

### They are a monopoly, they are closed and self-referenced

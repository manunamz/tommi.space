After months thinkering about it, I might be able to say that the short answer to the title is “to feel better”.

The two immediate clarifications following from the short answer are:
- no, I am not quitting social media exclusively because I want to feel better
- no, of course quitting social media isn't the only thing which separates me from absolute happiness.

Now, before diving deeper, there is one least further premise to do: while in this article I will focus on explaining *my* personal reasons for quitting social media, I made [a website](https://quitsocialmedia.club 'Quit Social Media') which collects articles and all sorts of data which proves how bad social media are, independently from their evident and awesome qualities.
